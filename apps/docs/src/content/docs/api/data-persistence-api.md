title: Data Persistence API
description: Store Flue session conversation state through the public persistence contract.
---

The data persistence API controls **session conversation state**: recorded messages, task relationships, compaction summaries, and metadata needed to reopen a session. It does not store sandbox files or create workflow run history.

For deciding what must survive deployment, see [Build & Deploy](/docs/guide/deployment/) and [Harness](/docs/guide/harness/#choose-state-and-persistence-boundaries).

## Imports

```ts
import {
  createAgent,
  type SessionData,
  type SessionStore,
} from '@flue/runtime';
```

## `SessionStore`

```ts
interface SessionStore {
  save(id: string, data: SessionData): Promise<void>;
  load(id: string): Promise<SessionData | null>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

| Method | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `save(id, data)` | Persist the complete current session record under the supplied Flue storage key. |
| `load(id)` | Return previously saved session data, or `null` when no stored session exists. |
| `delete(id)` | Delete the stored session state for that key. |

Choose a store with consistency, retention, access control, and tenant-isolation properties appropriate to the conversation content your application retains.

## Configure `persist`

Return a `SessionStore` in created-agent runtime configuration:

```ts title=".flue/agents/support.ts"
import { createAgent, type SessionStore } from '@flue/runtime';
import { sessionStore } from '../storage/session-store.ts';

const persist: SessionStore = sessionStore;

export default createAgent(() => ({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6',
  persist,
}));
```

`persist` applies to sessions initialized from that created agent. It is not an `init(...)` option because it determines the agent environment's conversation-state boundary.

## `SessionData`

```ts
interface SessionData {
  version: 3;
  entries: SessionEntry[];
  leafId: string | null;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

`entries` contains the stored session history tree:

| Entry kind | Contains |
| --- | --- |
| `message` | Recorded user, assistant, and tool-shaped messages, including dispatch metadata where applicable. |
| `compaction` | Summaries and token accounting used to shorten active model context. |
| `branch_summary` | Summary records for retained branch information. |

Treat `SessionData` as potentially sensitive. It can include model-visible text, tool output, dispatch input snapshots, and summaries derived from earlier content.

## Target defaults

| Runtime path | Default conversation-state behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Generated Node.js application with no `persist` override | Uses process-memory storage; state is lost on restart and is not shared between replicas. |
| Generated Cloudflare Durable Object-backed agent/workflow path with no `persist` override | Uses Durable Object SQLite-backed session storage by default when the durable storage context is available. |
| Created agent returning `persist` | Uses the supplied `SessionStore` instead of the target default for its sessions. |

## Separate persistence responsibilities

| State category | Controlled by |
| --- | --- |
| Agent session messages and compaction state | `SessionStore` / `persist` or the target default |
| Sandbox files, installed dependencies, and workspace artifacts | The configured sandbox or connector |
| Workflow run records and persisted run events | Workflow-run runtime storage, not `SessionStore` alone |
| Mutations performed through tools or external APIs | The external system and application idempotency policy |

A persisted conversation does not make sandbox files durable. A durable workspace does not retain conversation history unless session persistence does as well.

## Identity and deletion

Session data is stored under keys derived from Flue identity boundaries: agent instance or workflow invocation ownership, harness name, and session name. Deleting a session removes its stored conversation data and stored child task-session tree; it does not undo external effects or remove sandbox files.

## Implementing a store

A custom store can use any application-controlled durable backend, such as Postgres, SQLite, Redis, or another database. Implement complete record replacement or suitable atomic behavior for your backend, since Flue calls `save(...)` with the current `SessionData` representation.

```ts
import type { SessionData, SessionStore } from '@flue/runtime';

export const sessionStore: SessionStore = {
  async save(id: string, data: SessionData) {
    await database.sessions.upsert(id, data);
  },
  async load(id: string) {
    return await database.sessions.get(id);
  },
  async delete(id: string) {
    await database.sessions.delete(id);
  },
};
```

Keep database credentials in trusted runtime configuration, enforce access control around routes that reopen sessions, and verify restart behavior in the deployment environment where continuity matters.
