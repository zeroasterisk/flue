title: Streaming Protocol
description: Reference for reading Flue agent and workflow event streams over Durable Streams.
---

Flue implements the [Durable Streams](https://durablestreams.com) read protocol for agent-instance and workflow-run events. This page is for raw HTTP consumers. SDK users usually use `client.agents.stream()`, `client.runs.stream()`, or `client.runs.events()` instead.

## Stream routes

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /agents/:name/:id` | Read one agent instance stream. |
| `HEAD /agents/:name/:id` | Read agent stream metadata without a body. |
| `GET /runs/:runId` | Read one workflow-run stream. |
| `HEAD /runs/:runId` | Read workflow-run metadata without a body. |

Agent streams exist after the first admitted prompt for that instance. Workflow-run streams exist after workflow admission. Missing streams return `404`.

## Read modes

A plain `GET` performs a catch-up read and returns a JSON array of event payloads.

```http
GET /runs/workflow:summarize:01JX...?offset=-1
```

Use `?live=long-poll` for one waitable read, or `?live=sse` for a continuous event stream. Live reads require `offset`.

```http
GET /runs/workflow:summarize:01JX...?offset=0000000000000000_0000000000000005&live=long-poll
GET /runs/workflow:summarize:01JX...?offset=0000000000000000_0000000000000005&live=sse
```

Supported `live` values are `long-poll` and `sse`. Any other value, duplicate `offset` parameter, malformed offset, or live request without `offset` returns `400`.

A long-poll read waits up to 30 seconds for new data before returning `204`. An idle SSE connection receives `: heartbeat` comment frames every 15 seconds and a keep-alive control frame after each 30-second internal wait.

## Offsets

Offsets are opaque Durable Streams coordinates. Flue currently formats them as two zero-padded integer components, such as `0000000000000000_0000000000000005`. Consumers should treat them as opaque strings and pass back the latest returned value rather than parsing them.

| Offset | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `-1` | Read from the beginning of the stream. |
| `now` | Read from the current tail. In live mode, wait for events appended after the current tail. |
| Returned offset | Resume strictly after that event. |

The SDK exposes a resume offset as `stream.offset`. It is batch-granular: it reflects the `Stream-Next-Offset` of the most recently fetched HTTP response, not the last delivered event, so checkpointing it mid-batch and resuming from it skips the rest of that batch. For per-event checkpoints on workflow-run streams use the event's `eventIndex` (there it equals the stream sequence; agent streams restart `eventIndex` per prompt, so it is not an offset there); `flue logs --format ndjson` prints a per-event `offset` derived from it. `agents.send()` and `agents.prompt()` return an offset captured before that prompt is admitted, so reading from that offset yields that prompt's events. `workflows.invoke()` returns a run ID and stream URL, not an initial stream offset.

## Response headers

| Header | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Stream-Next-Offset` | Offset to use for the next read. |
| `Stream-Up-To-Date` | `true` when the read reached the current tail. |
| `Stream-Closed` | `true` when the stream is closed and no more events can arrive. |
| `Stream-Cursor` | Cursor for long-poll continuation. |
| `ETag` | Cache validator for catch-up and long-poll reads except `offset=now`. |
| `Cache-Control` | `no-store` on catch-up reads, long-poll `200` responses, and `HEAD`; `no-cache` on SSE responses; absent on long-poll `204` responses. |

A conditional catch-up read with `If-None-Match` may return `304`. `offset=now` does not emit an ETag because its meaning is relative to the time of the request. `HEAD` returns stream metadata with the same stream headers and no body.

## Status behavior

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `200` | Read returned event data. Catch-up and long-poll bodies are JSON arrays. |
| `204` | Long-poll reached its 30-second timeout without new data. |
| `304` | Conditional read matched the current ETag. |
| `400` | Invalid stream query. |
| `404` | Stream does not exist or is not accessible. |

A closed stream can still return stored history. Once caught up, its response includes `Stream-Closed: true`. Long-poll returns immediately for a closed, caught-up stream.

## SSE framing

SSE responses use named frames:

- `event: data` frames whose `data:` payload is a JSON **array** of event payloads. One frame may carry multiple events.
- `event: control` frames whose payload is a JSON object containing `streamNextOffset` and, depending on stream state, `streamCursor`, `upToDate`, and `streamClosed`. Flue emits a control frame after each data batch and as a keep-alive while an open stream stays idle.
- `: heartbeat` comment frames every 15 seconds to keep idle connections alive.

Consumers that only need event payloads can read `event: data` frames and ignore control and heartbeat frames, but should track `streamNextOffset` from control frames to resume correctly after a disconnect.

SSE is intended for live tailing, not browser caching. Flue sends `Cache-Control: no-cache` on SSE responses (matching the Durable Streams reference server) and does not rely on intermediary cacheability for stream reads.
