description: Reference for reading Flue agent conversations and workflow events over Durable Streams.

Flue uses Durable Streams offsets for agent conversations and workflow-run events. SDK users should use `client.agents.history()` and `client.agents.updates()` for agents, or `client.runs.stream()` and `client.runs.events()` for workflows.

## Stream routes

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /agents/:name/:id?view=history` | Read one materialized agent conversation snapshot. |
| `GET /agents/:name/:id?view=updates&offset=...` | Read conversation updates after an offset. |
| `GET /agents/:name/:id?view=activity&offset=...` | Read raw canonical activity after an offset. |
| `HEAD /agents/:name/:id` | Read agent stream metadata. |
| `GET /runs/:runId` | Read workflow-run events. |
| `HEAD /runs/:runId` | Read workflow-run stream metadata. |

A plain agent `GET` defaults to the history view. Agent views select the active `default` harness and session unless `conversationId`, `harness`, or `session` is provided.

## Agent history and updates

History returns one JSON snapshot after reducing the complete physical stream prefix. Its `offset` is the physical agent-instance tail, including records omitted from that conversation's projection.

Updates require `offset` and resume strictly after it. Use `live=long-poll` for one waitable read or `live=sse` for a continuous stream. Do not resume without retaining the projection state produced by the matching history snapshot; request fresh history when local state is unavailable.

The current server reconstructs the canonical prefix through the supplied offset when an updates connection starts. Reconnect cost therefore grows with the physical agent-instance stream. Snapshot-assisted prefix loading is planned before Flue claims unbounded high-volume conversation support; applications with very large streams should measure reconnect latency and avoid unnecessary reconnect loops.

Agent history and updates do not support `tail`. A suffix can omit message starts, branches, compaction state, or earlier deltas and cannot be reduced safely.

## Workflow reads

A plain workflow-run `GET` performs a catch-up read and returns a JSON array of versioned workflow events.

```http
GET /runs/run_01JX...?offset=-1
GET /runs/run_01JX...?offset=0000000000000000_0000000000000005&live=sse
```

Workflow-run streams retain `tail=N` for bounded event inspection.

## Offsets

Offsets are opaque resume-after tokens. Pass returned values back unchanged; do not parse or increment them.

One agent offset identifies one atomic canonical record batch. SDK stream checkpoints advance only after every public update derived from that batch has been delivered. A filtered batch may advance the offset without producing an update.

## Response headers

| Header | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Stream-Next-Offset` | Offset to use for the next read. |
| `Stream-Up-To-Date` | `true` when the read reached the current tail. |
| `Stream-Closed` | `true` when no more records can arrive. |
| `Stream-Cursor` | Cursor for long-poll continuation. |

Catch-up responses use `Cache-Control: no-store`; SSE uses `Cache-Control: no-cache`.

## SSE framing

SSE responses contain:

- `event: data` frames with a JSON array of updates or events;
- `event: control` frames with `streamNextOffset` and optional `upToDate` or `streamClosed` fields;
- heartbeat comments on idle connections.

Track `streamNextOffset` from control frames to resume after a disconnect.
