Observable runtime types and global observation APIs are exported from `@flue/runtime`.

```ts
import {
  type AttachedAgentEvent,
  type FlueEvent,
  observe,
  type FlueEventSubscriber,
} from '@flue/runtime';
```

## Runtime events

`FlueEvent` is the observable runtime activity union. Workflow invocations emit workflow-run events with `runId`. Direct prompts and asynchronously dispatched agent inputs emit agent activity with `instanceId`; dispatched activity may also carry `dispatchId`. Those interactions are not workflow runs.

Runtime-emitted events receive a per-context `eventIndex` and `timestamp`. Applicable events may also carry harness and session names, generated operation and turn ids, task correlation, and parent-session correlation. Events are durably stored in an event stream and can be replayed from any offset via the Durable Streams protocol.

Runtime events can contain payloads, prompts, system instructions, reasoning-bearing messages, image bytes, logs, tool arguments, tool results, and terminal errors. Apply an exporter-local sanitization policy before forwarding events to an external service.

### Lifecycle events

| Event         | Meaning                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `run_start`   | Workflow run started. Includes workflow ownership and payload.                                                  |
| `run_resume`  | Recovery continued handling an admitted workflow run after interruption. Workflow code did not resume or retry. It can be the first persisted lifecycle event when interruption occurs after admission but before `run_start`. |
| `run_end`     | Workflow run ended. Includes result or error state and duration.                                                |
| `agent_start` | Agent loop started.                                                                                             |
| `agent_end`   | Agent loop ended.                                                                                               |
| `idle`        | Agent activity became idle.                                                                                     |

### Agent operations

| Event             | Meaning                                                                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `operation_start` | A `prompt`, `skill`, `task`, `shell`, or `compact` operation started.             |
| `operation`       | An operation ended. Includes duration, error state, and optional result or usage. |
| `task_start`      | Delegated task started.                                                           |
| `task`            | Delegated task ended.                                                             |

Operations, turns, task ids, and tool-call ids are generated correlation boundaries. Harnesses and sessions have names. Harness-level shell activity emits tool telemetry without a session operation boundary.

### Model turns

| Event                                              | Meaning                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `turn_start`                                       | Model turn started.                                                                                     |
| `turn_request`                                     | Model-visible request. Includes provider, model, input, tools, and optional reasoning level.            |
| `turn_end`                                         | Detailed model turn ended. Includes assistant message and tool results.                                 |
| `turn`                                             | Normalized terminal model-turn telemetry. Includes duration, error state, and optional output or usage. |
| `message_start`, `message_update`, `message_end`   | Detailed assistant-message stream.                                                                      |
| `text_delta`                                       | Text stream delta.                                                                                      |
| `thinking_start`, `thinking_delta`, `thinking_end` | Thinking stream lifecycle.                                                                              |

`turn_request` and `turn` use purpose `agent`, `compaction`, or `compaction_prefix`. Select detailed or normalized events intentionally when an observer must avoid double-counting model activity.

### Tool calls

| Event        | Meaning                                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tool_start` | Tool execution started. Includes tool name and arguments.              |
| `tool_call`  | Tool execution ended. Includes duration, error state, and result.      |

Both model-driven and programmatic (`shell()`) tool activity emit `tool_start` and `tool_call`. Use `toolCallId` to correlate related events.

### Compaction

| Event              | Meaning                                                                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `compaction_start` | Conversation compaction started. Includes `threshold`, `overflow`, or `manual` reason. |
| `compaction`       | Conversation compaction ended. Includes message counts, duration, and optional usage.  |

### Logs

| Event | Meaning                                                                                   |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `log` | Structured application log with `info`, `warn`, or `error` level and optional attributes. |

#### `FlueEvent`

```ts
type FlueEvent = RuntimeEventVariant & {
  runId?: string;
  instanceId?: string;
  dispatchId?: string;
  eventIndex?: number;
  timestamp?: string;
  session?: string;
  parentSession?: string;
  taskId?: string;
  harness?: string;
  operationId?: string;
  turnId?: string;
};
```

## Attached agent events

Attached-agent events represent direct-agent activity. They omit workflow lifecycle events, require `instanceId`, and never carry `runId`.

#### `AttachedAgentEvent`

```ts
type AttachedAgentEvent = Exclude<
  FlueEvent,
  { type: 'run_start' } | { type: 'run_resume' } | { type: 'run_end' }
> & {
  runId?: never;
  instanceId: string;
};
```

## Global observation

### `observe(...)`

```ts
function observe(subscriber: FlueEventSubscriber): () => void;
```

Subscribes to live workflow-run and agent-interaction activity emitted in the current isolate. The returned function unsubscribes the listener. Subscribers run synchronously from the event emission path with isolated JSON snapshots. Keep callbacks lightweight and queue substantial asynchronous work instead of blocking emission. Returned promises are observed for rejection but are not awaited.

See [Observability](/docs/guide/observability/) for application setup and exporter guidance.

#### `FlueEventSubscriber`

```ts
type FlueEventSubscriber = (event: FlueEvent, ctx: FlueContext) => void | Promise<void>;
```

Receives an isolated decorated event snapshot and its originating context. Subscriber failures are logged and do not halt event dispatch or the originating execution. If an event cannot be serialized as JSON, Flue logs the snapshot failure and skips global observer delivery for that event.

## Public errors

Transport errors use the shared `FluePublicError` shape. See [Errors Reference](/docs/api/errors-reference/) for its fields, stable categories, transport envelopes, and the distinction between transport errors and open-ended workflow failure records.
