## Add WhatsApp

Run the WhatsApp recipe through your coding agent:

```sh
flue add channel whatsapp --print | codex
```

It installs `@flue/whatsapp` for verified ingress and
`@kapso/whatsapp-cloud-api` for project-owned Graph API access. `@flue/whatsapp`
requires Node 24 because its selected webhook type package declares that engine
floor. The client is Fetch-based and runs in Node and workerd with Flue's
required `nodejs_compat` configuration.

Set the callback URL to:

```txt
https://example.com/channels/whatsapp/webhook
```

## Channel module

```ts title="src/channels/whatsapp.ts"
import {
  createWhatsAppChannel,
  type WebhookMessage,
  type WebhookValue,
  type WhatsAppConversationRef,
} from '@flue/whatsapp';
import { defineTool, dispatch } from '@flue/runtime';
import { WhatsAppClient, type SendMessageResponse } from '@kapso/whatsapp-cloud-api';
import assistant from '../agents/assistant.ts';

export const client = new WhatsAppClient({
  accessToken: process.env.WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN!,
  graphVersion: 'v25.0',
});

export const channel = createWhatsAppChannel({
  appSecret: process.env.WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET!,
  verifyToken: process.env.WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN!,

  // Paths: GET and POST /channels/whatsapp/webhook
  async webhook({ payload }) {
    const expectedPhoneNumberId = process.env.WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID!;
    for (const entry of payload.entry) {
      for (const change of entry.changes) {
        if (change.field !== 'messages') continue;
        const value = change.value;
        // Filtering authenticated deliveries by phone number is application policy.
        if (value.metadata.phone_number_id !== expectedPhoneNumberId) continue;
        for (const message of value.messages ?? []) {
          if (message.type !== 'text' && message.type !== 'interactive') continue;
          await dispatch(assistant, {
            id: channel.conversationKey(conversationRef(entry.id, value, message)),
            input: {
              type: `whatsapp.${message.type}`,
              messageId: message.id,
              message,
            },
          });
        }
      }
    }
  },
});

// Derive stable individual identity from the business-scoped user id.
function conversationRef(
  businessAccountId: string,
  value: WebhookValue,
  message: WebhookMessage,
): WhatsAppConversationRef {
  const phoneNumberId = value.metadata.phone_number_id;
  if (message.group_id) {
    return { type: 'group', businessAccountId, phoneNumberId, groupId: message.group_id };
  }
  return {
    type: 'individual',
    businessAccountId,
    phoneNumberId,
    destination: { type: 'user-id', userId: message.from_user_id },
  };
}

function sendTextMessage(ref: WhatsAppConversationRef, body: string): Promise<SendMessageResponse> {
  if (ref.type === 'group') {
    return client.messages.sendText({
      phoneNumberId: ref.phoneNumberId,
      recipientType: 'group',
      to: ref.groupId,
      body,
    });
  }
  if (ref.destination.type === 'phone-number') {
    return client.messages.sendText({
      phoneNumberId: ref.phoneNumberId,
      recipientType: 'individual',
      to: ref.destination.phoneNumber,
      body,
    });
  }
  return client.request<SendMessageResponse>('POST', `${ref.phoneNumberId}/messages`, {
    body: {
      messaging_product: 'whatsapp',
      recipient_type: 'individual',
      recipient: ref.destination.userId,
      type: 'text',
      text: { body },
    },
    responseType: 'json',
  });
}

export function postMessage(ref: WhatsAppConversationRef) {
  return defineTool({
    name: 'post_whatsapp_message',
    description: 'Post to the WhatsApp conversation bound to this agent.',
    parameters: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        text: { type: 'string', minLength: 1, maxLength: 4096 },
      },
      required: ['text'],
      additionalProperties: false,
    },
    async execute({ text }) {
      const result = await sendTextMessage(ref, text);
      return JSON.stringify({ messageId: result.messages[0]?.id });
    },
  });
}
```

Bind the tool from the agent with
`postMessage(channel.parseConversationKey(id))`. Trusted application code
selects the destination; the model selects only message text.

## Configure the webhook

Configure the Meta app with the route above and a random
`WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN`. Subscribe the WhatsApp Business Account to the
`messages` field.

Meta sends GET requests for `hub.challenge` verification and signs POST bodies
with the app secret in `X-Hub-Signature-256`. The package verifies the exact
bytes, then forwards Meta's provider-native payload unmodified. It does not
filter by business account or phone number; restricting to your configured
phone number (`metadata.phone_number_id`) or business account (`entry[].id`) is
application policy, as the handler above shows.

Use a system-user or business access token for production outbound calls. Keep
Graph API versions explicit and test an upgrade before changing them.

## Delivery behavior

One POST can contain many entries, changes, messages, and statuses. The callback
runs once with the complete verified delivery; `payload` is Meta's
provider-native webhook object, forwarded unmodified and typed by the
third-party, community-maintained `@whatsapp-cloudapi/types` package. Walk
`payload.entry[].changes[]` in the order Meta sent them, narrow on
`change.field`, then on `message.type` or `status`, and process every applicable
item before returning.

The `message.type` discriminant covers text, image, audio, video, document,
sticker, location, contacts, interactive button/list/flow replies, legacy
buttons, reactions, order, system, and unsupported messages. Authenticated future
shapes still forward at runtime, but may require an application cast or type
guard until the type package models them. The `status` discriminant preserves
`sent`, `delivered`, `read`, `played`, and `failed`.

Returning nothing produces an empty `200`. A JSON-compatible value becomes the
response body; a Hono or Fetch `Response` passes through. A thrown handler is
not swallowed and reaches Hono's error handler.

Meta expects a prompt `200` (within a few seconds) or it may mark the webhook
inactive, and it retries non-`200` deliveries with decreasing frequency for up
to seven days, so duplicates are expected. Admit durable work quickly (dispatch,
then return) instead of blocking on slow operations. The channel is stateless
and does not deduplicate; claim message ids in durable application storage
before dispatch when duplicate admission is unacceptable.

## Conversation identity

Meta supplies a Business-Scoped User ID (`from_user_id`) in incoming message
webhooks and may omit or change the sender phone number (`from`) as account
features evolve. The `conversationRef` helper above always uses `from_user_id`
for stable inbound individual identity, even when `from` is present. Group
destinations use the provider `group_id`.

The current SDK release exposes broad Graph API helpers but its high-level text
helper models only `to`. The example keeps the full exported SDK client and
uses its authenticated low-level `request()` method for the documented BSUID
`recipient` shape. Test each relied-on operation against fake Fetch in Node and
workerd.

Native media payloads carry a bearer-authenticated media `id` (and, on newer
API versions, a transient `url`). Treat both as transport credentials: download
media with the project-owned client using the verified id, and avoid forwarding
the raw `payload` or media URLs into model context wholesale.
