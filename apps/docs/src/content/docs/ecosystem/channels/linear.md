## Add Linear

Run the Linear recipe through your coding agent:

```sh
flue add channel linear --print | codex
```

It installs `@flue/linear` for verified ingress and the official
`@linear/sdk` for project-owned outbound API access. Linear uses that SDK in
its own Cloudflare Workers agent example with `nodejs_compat`, which Flue's
Cloudflare target already enables.

Set the webhook URL to:

```txt
https://example.com/channels/linear/webhook
```

## Channel module

```ts title="src/channels/linear.ts"
import {
  createLinearChannel,
  type LinearConversationRef,
  type LinearWebhookPayload,
} from '@flue/linear';
import { defineTool, dispatch } from '@flue/runtime';
import { LinearClient } from '@linear/sdk';
import type {
  AgentSessionEventWebhookPayload,
  EntityWebhookPayloadWithCommentData,
} from '@linear/sdk/webhooks';
import assistant from '../agents/assistant.ts';

const organizationId = process.env.LINEAR_ORGANIZATION_ID;

export const client = new LinearClient({
  apiKey: process.env.LINEAR_API_KEY!,
});

export const channel = createLinearChannel({
  webhookSecret: process.env.LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET!,
  ...(organizationId ? { organizationId } : {}),

  // Path: /channels/linear/webhook
  async webhook({ payload, deliveryId }) {
    if (isCommentEvent(payload)) {
      const comment = payload.data;
      if (payload.action !== 'create' || !comment.issueId) return;
      await dispatch(assistant, {
        id: channel.conversationKey({
          type: 'issue',
          organizationId: payload.organizationId,
          issueId: comment.issueId,
          ...(comment.parentId ? { threadCommentId: comment.parentId } : {}),
        }),
        input: {
          type: 'linear.comment.created',
          deliveryId,
          actor: payload.actor,
          comment,
        },
      });
      return;
    }

    if (isAgentSessionEvent(payload)) {
      await dispatch(assistant, {
        id: channel.conversationKey({
          type: 'agent-session',
          organizationId: payload.organizationId,
          agentSessionId: payload.agentSession.id,
        }),
        input: {
          type: `linear.agent_session.${payload.action}`,
          promptContext: payload.promptContext,
          activity: payload.agentActivity,
        },
      });
    }
  },
});

// Linear's native union has a catch-all member that keeps `type` widened, so a
// literal `type` check alone does not narrow. Combine it with a nested field.
function isCommentEvent(
  payload: LinearWebhookPayload,
): payload is EntityWebhookPayloadWithCommentData {
  return payload.type === 'Comment' && 'body' in payload.data;
}

function isAgentSessionEvent(
  payload: LinearWebhookPayload,
): payload is AgentSessionEventWebhookPayload {
  return payload.type === 'AgentSessionEvent' && 'agentSession' in payload;
}

export function postMessage(ref: LinearConversationRef) {
  return defineTool({
    name: 'post_linear_message',
    description: 'Post to the Linear conversation bound to this agent.',
    parameters: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: { text: { type: 'string', minLength: 1 } },
      required: ['text'],
      additionalProperties: false,
    },
    async execute({ text }) {
      if (ref.type === 'agent-session') {
        const result = await client.createAgentActivity({
          agentSessionId: ref.agentSessionId,
          content: { type: 'response', body: text },
        });
        return JSON.stringify({ success: result.success });
      }

      const result = await client.createComment({
        issueId: ref.issueId,
        ...(ref.threadCommentId ? { parentId: ref.threadCommentId } : {}),
        body: text,
      });
      return JSON.stringify({ success: result.success });
    },
  });
}
```

Use `accessToken` instead of `apiKey` for an installed OAuth application.
OAuth installation storage and organization-specific token selection remain
application concerns.

## Bind the tool

```ts title="src/agents/assistant.ts"
import { createAgent } from '@flue/runtime';
import { channel, postMessage } from '../channels/linear.ts';

export default createAgent(({ id }) => ({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5',
  tools: [postMessage(channel.parseConversationKey(id))],
}));
```

Trusted code binds the organization, issue thread, or agent session. The model
selects only message text.

## Resource webhooks

Create a Linear webhook for the resource families the application handles,
typically Comments, Issues, and Projects. The package verifies the exact body
against `Linear-Signature`, rejects signed timestamps outside one minute, and
optionally checks configured organization and webhook ids.

The handler receives the provider-native `payload`, typed by Linear's official
`LinearWebhookPayload` union (re-exported from `@linear/sdk/webhooks`). Entity
deliveries are discriminated on `type` (`'Comment'`, `'Issue'`, `'Project'`, …)
and carry `action` and `data`; Flue forwards the body unmodified, including
verified deliveries the union does not model. The union has a catch-all member
that keeps `type` widened to `string`, so a literal `type` check alone does not
narrow it — pair the literal with a discriminating nested field in a small
application-side type guard (as in the channel module above).

The application derives conversation keys from native fields. Top-level comments
use the issue conversation; replies pass the root comment id as
`threadCommentId` for the nested thread.

## Agent sessions

Enable Agent session events on a Linear OAuth application configured as an app
actor. Install it with the scopes required by your operations and
`app:mentionable` when users should mention the agent.

`created` events carry the `agentSession` and may include Linear's formatted
`promptContext`, `previousComments`, and `guidance`. `prompted` events carry the
new `agentActivity`. The application builds a stable agent-session conversation
key from `payload.agentSession.id`.

Linear expects the webhook response within five seconds and a new session to
receive an activity or external URL update within ten seconds. Keep the
verified handler focused on durable dispatch admission, then use the
project-owned SDK client to post progress and results.

## Delivery behavior

Returning nothing produces an empty `200`. Return JSON for a response body or
use the Hono context for explicit status control. A failure or non-`200`
response asks Linear to retry.

Linear treats a delivery as failed if it does not return `200` within five
seconds, then retries after one minute, one hour, and six hours. The channel
does not enforce a timer; admit durable work quickly (dispatch, then return) and
rely on idempotency rather than blocking on slow work before responding.

The channel requires Linear's UUID-v4 `Linear-Delivery` header and exposes it
for application-owned deduplication, but does not persist delivery state.
Conversation keys validate syntax, not authorization.

See the [`@flue/linear` API reference](/docs/api/linear-channel/).
