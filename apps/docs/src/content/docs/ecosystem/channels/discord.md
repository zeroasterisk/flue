## Add Discord

Add Discord as an inbound channel to any existing Flue project by running the
following command in your terminal, or your coding agent of choice.

```sh
flue add channel discord
```

The recipe installs and configures `@flue/discord` for inbound HTTP
interactions, along with a project-owned `@discordjs/rest` client for outbound
API calls. After running the command, you will have a new
`src/channels/discord.ts` module exporting `channel` and `client`.

Discord does not publish an official JavaScript REST SDK. The recipe uses the
community-maintained `@discordjs/rest` client. Your application owns that client
and its outbound API calls; `@flue/discord` handles only verified inbound HTTP
interactions.

## Configure Discord

Set these application secrets:

| Variable             | Purpose                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY` | Verifies inbound interaction request bytes. |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`  | Authenticates outbound Discord REST calls.  |

In the Discord Developer Portal, set the application's Interactions Endpoint
URL to the full public HTTPS route:

```txt
https://example.com/channels/discord/interactions
```

Register only the application commands your project handles. Endpoint and
command registration are provider setup owned by the application, not by the
channel package.

## Supported HTTP interaction

| Discord surface | Webhook path                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Interactions    | `/channels/discord/interactions` |

Discord can deliver [interactions](https://docs.discord.com/developers/interactions/receiving-and-responding)
through the Gateway or an outgoing webhook, but not both for the same
application. `@flue/discord` implements the verified HTTP path. Discord Gateway
is a persistent WebSocket transport and remains outside the channel model.

Signed PING requests are answered with PONG internally before application code
runs.

### Interactions

```ts title="src/channels/discord.ts"
import { type APIInteractionResponse, createDiscordChannel } from '@flue/discord';

export const channel = createDiscordChannel({
  publicKey: process.env.DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY!,

  // Path: /channels/discord/interactions
  async interactions({ interaction }) {
    if (interaction.type === 4) {
      return {
        type: 8,
        data: { choices: [] },
      } satisfies APIInteractionResponse;
    }

    if (interaction.type === 2 && interaction.data.name === 'ask') {
      return {
        type: 4,
        data: { content: 'Your request was accepted.', flags: 64 },
      } satisfies APIInteractionResponse;
    }

    return {
      type: 4,
      data: { content: 'Unsupported interaction.', flags: 64 },
    } satisfies APIInteractionResponse;
  },
});
```

`interaction` is Discord's provider-native API v10 object. Its numeric `type`
discriminant narrows commands, autocomplete requests, message components, and
modal submissions while preserving Discord's snake_case fields and nesting.
The package does not filter authenticated interaction families; the handler
decides which ones affect the application.

The callback uses the current `APIInteraction` union for strong narrowing.
Authenticated future numeric types are still forwarded at runtime, so an
exhaustive branch should tolerate an unfamiliar numeric value after a Discord
API change.

### Respond within Discord's deadline

Every non-PING HTTP interaction requires a valid Discord interaction response.
Discord invalidates the interaction token if the initial response is not sent
within three seconds. The package awaits the application handler and does not
impose a separate timeout, so admit durable work promptly and return within that
provider deadline.

An immediate message response uses callback type `4`. A deferred response uses
type `5` when the application will complete the interaction through Discord's
webhook API. Interaction tokens remain valid for follow-up operations for up to
15 minutes.

`interaction.token` is a short-lived response capability. Use it only in
immediate trusted application code. Keep it out of dispatched input, model
context, logs, and durable session history.

See Discord's [interaction callback documentation](https://docs.discord.com/developers/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-callback)
for the response types allowed by each interaction family.

### Choose a conversation destination

Not every interaction represents a durable Discord channel conversation. When
an interaction should continue an agent instance, application code can derive a
`DiscordDestinationRef` from native `guild_id`, `channel.id`, `channel.type`, and
`context` fields. The complete generated example from `flue add channel discord` shows
that derivation and dispatches with `channel.conversationKey(ref)`.

Some valid interactions, including modal submissions, may omit a channel.
Private-channel interactions can be acknowledged through their interaction
token, but that capability does not grant the bot arbitrary channel-message
access.

Use `channel.conversationKey(ref)` when a Discord destination should continue
the same agent instance. Conversation keys are identifiers, not authorization
capabilities. See the shared [Channels guide](/docs/guide/channels/) for dispatch,
authorization, and deduplication guidance.

## Outbound REST

Outbound Discord behavior belongs to the exported project-owned client:

```ts title="src/channels/discord.ts"
import { REST } from '@discordjs/rest';

export const client = new REST({ version: '10' }).setToken(process.env.DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN!);
```

Bot-token messages, application-command registration, and interaction-token
follow-ups or edits are Discord REST operations. They are not implemented by
`@flue/discord`.

## Discord Tools

Use the client to define an application-owned tool with its destination bound in
trusted code:

```ts title="src/channels/discord.ts"
import { defineTool } from '@flue/runtime';
import type { DiscordDestinationRef } from '@flue/discord';

export function postMessage(ref: DiscordDestinationRef) {
  return defineTool({
    name: 'post_discord_message',
    description: 'Post to the Discord destination bound to this agent.',
    parameters: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: { content: { type: 'string', minLength: 1 } },
      required: ['content'],
      additionalProperties: false,
    },
    async execute({ content }) {
      const result = (await client.post(`/channels/${ref.channelId}/messages`, {
        body: { content },
      })) as { id?: string };
      return JSON.stringify({ messageId: result.id });
    },
  });
}
```

Bind the destination when creating the agent:

```ts title="src/agents/assistant.ts"
import { createAgent } from '@flue/runtime';
import { channel, postMessage } from '../channels/discord.ts';

export default createAgent(({ id }) => ({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5',
  tools: [postMessage(channel.parseConversationKey(id))],
}));
```

The model selects message content. It does not select arbitrary Discord
channels, credentials, or REST methods. This tool creates an ordinary bot-token
channel message, not an interaction follow-up or guaranteed ephemeral response.

## Delivery and runtime behavior

Discord does not document dependable interaction redelivery behavior. Preserve
`interaction.id` for tracing, and claim it in application-owned durable storage
before dispatch when duplicate admission is unacceptable. The channel itself is
stateless and does not deduplicate interaction ids.

`@flue/discord` runs in Node and Cloudflare Workers with Flue's required
`nodejs_compat` setting. The example executes `@discordjs/rest` channel-message
request construction against a fail-closed fake Fetch transport in both
runtimes. Validate any additional REST operations your application depends on.
