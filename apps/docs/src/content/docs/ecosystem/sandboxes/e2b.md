title: E2B
description: Connect a Flue agent to an E2B Linux sandbox.
---

The E2B connector adapts an initialized E2B sandbox from the `e2b` package into Flue's sandbox interface. Use it for provider-managed Linux execution when an agent needs shell commands and workspace files outside the application host.

## Add the connector

```bash
pnpm exec flue add e2b
```

## Requirements

| Requirement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Provider package | `e2b` |
| Credential | `E2B_API_KEY` |
| Environment | Provider-managed Linux sandbox |
| Lifecycle ownership | Your application creates and closes or retains the sandbox |

## Integration shape

```ts
import { Sandbox } from 'e2b';
import { createAgent } from '@flue/runtime';
import { e2b } from '../connectors/e2b';

const sandbox = await Sandbox.create();
const agent = createAgent(() => ({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6',
  sandbox: e2b(sandbox),
}));
```

Select templates, timeouts, network access, secret exposure, and resource reuse through your application and provider policy. Flue adapts the active environment; it does not choose provider retention for you.
