description: Connect Flue agents to Mirage workspaces and mounted resources.
---

The Mirage connector adapts an application-owned Mirage `Workspace` into Flue's sandbox interface. Mirage offers runtime packages for Node and browser-class runtimes, allowing the connector pattern to be used on Node or Cloudflare when you choose compatible resources.

## Add the connector

```bash
pnpm exec flue add mirage
```

## Requirements

| Target | Runtime package | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js | `@struktoai/mirage-node` | Can use Node-compatible Mirage resources. |
| Cloudflare | `@struktoai/mirage-browser` | Use browser-compatible Workspace resources only. |

The generated connector uses Mirage's shared workspace contract. Some Mirage resources, such as SSH- or database-oriented Node resources, require the Node runtime and must not be imported into a Cloudflare build.

## Choose this connector when

Use Mirage when your application wants to assemble a workspace from explicit mounted resources and present that workspace to an agent through a single sandbox boundary. Your application owns resource mounting, credentials, writable boundaries, and workspace lifetime.
