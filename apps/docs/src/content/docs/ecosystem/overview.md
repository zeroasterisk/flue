description: Choose deployment environments and sandbox integrations for Flue applications.
---

The Flue ecosystem connects deployable applications to hosting environments and sandbox providers. Start with the [Build & Deploy](/docs/guide/deployment/) guide when deciding how an application should run, then use this section for a specific deployment destination or sandbox integration.

## Deployment environments

Flue builds application artifacts for Node.js and Cloudflare. Deployment pages document how those artifacts fit a particular host or execution environment.

| Destination | Use it for | Continue to… |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js | An ordinary long-running Node server or container. | [Deploy on Node.js](/docs/ecosystem/deploy/node/) |
| Cloudflare | A Worker with generated Durable Object-backed runtime integration. | [Deploy on Cloudflare](/docs/ecosystem/deploy/cloudflare/) |
| Render | A managed Node web service with optional managed persistence. | [Deploy on Render](/docs/ecosystem/deploy/render/) |
| GitHub Actions | One-shot Node workflow execution in CI. | [Use GitHub Actions](/docs/ecosystem/deploy/github-actions/) |
| GitLab CI/CD | One-shot Node workflow execution in CI. | [Use GitLab CI/CD](/docs/ecosystem/deploy/gitlab-ci/) |

Compare target behavior first in [Build & Deploy](/docs/guide/deployment/).

## Sandbox connectors

A sandbox connector adapts an application-owned compute or workspace environment into the Flue sandbox contract. A connector controls files and commands available to the agent; it is separate from session conversation storage and workflow run history.

The connector catalog includes remote Linux environments, platform-owned workspaces and containers, and local VM integrations. Choose a provider from the **Sandboxes** navigation group.

## Core guides

- [Sandboxes](/docs/guide/sandboxes/) explains how to choose a filesystem and execution boundary.
- [Harness](/docs/guide/harness/) explains session persistence versus workspace durability.
- [Routing](/docs/guide/routing/) explains which deployed application surfaces are public.
