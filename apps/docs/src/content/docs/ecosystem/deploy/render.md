Deploy Flue agents to Render as a Node.js web service. This guide starts from the [Flue template](https://render.com/templates/flue), builds on [Deploy Agents on Node.js](/docs/ecosystem/deploy/node/), and focuses on the Render-specific setup: Blueprints, service configuration, environment variables, and managed persistence.

By the end, you will have a live Render web service running Flue agents, and you will know how to add Render-managed persistence on top.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the [Deploy Agents on Node.js](/docs/ecosystem/deploy/node/) guide.
- An API key for your model provider. The template prompts for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` by default.

## 1. Deploy the template

Open the [Flue template](https://render.com/templates/flue) and click **Deploy to Render**. Render walks you through:

1. Authorizing Render's GitHub OAuth app.
2. Copying the template repo to your GitHub account.
3. Returning to Render and creating a free account if you are not signed in.
4. Opening the Blueprint deploy page for the new repo.

On the deploy page, paste your AI provider API key when prompted, then click **Deploy**. The Blueprint provisions a Node.js web service that runs `npm ci && npx flue build --target node` and starts it with `node dist/server.mjs`. If its Blueprint config uses `/health` for health checks, its authored `app.ts` must define that route; Flue does not generate a health endpoint automatically.

The template uses `plan: free` so first-time deploys cost nothing. Free instances spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity, and the next request pays a multi-second cold start while the Node process restarts. For agents that see sporadic traffic in production, bump the service to `starter` or higher in `render.yaml` (or from the Render Dashboard) to keep it warm.

When the deploy finishes, copy your service URL from the Render Dashboard. The rest of this guide uses `https://<service>.onrender.com`.

## 2. Test the live service

Start with the health endpoint:

```bash
curl https://<service>.onrender.com/health
```

A successful response confirms Render is forwarding traffic to the process started by `node dist/server.mjs`. If a call hangs or returns an error, open your service in the Render Dashboard and watch the **Logs** tab while you re-run the request. Every Flue agent invocation prints there.

Now call the `translate` workflow:

```bash
curl 'https://<service>.onrender.com/workflows/translate?wait=result' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello world", "language": "French"}'
```

`?wait=result` requests a completed workflow response rather than the default `202` admission response containing a `runId`. The returned `result` should match the workflow's structured output, like:

```json
{
  "translation": "Bonjour le monde",
  "confidence": "high"
}
```

The translation itself can vary by model. The shape is what matters.

Try a short conversation with the `assistant` agent:

```bash
curl https://<service>.onrender.com/agents/assistant/session-1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What is the capital of Japan?"}'
```

Then send a follow-up using the same session ID:

```bash
curl https://<service>.onrender.com/agents/assistant/session-1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "How many people live there?"}'
```

Reusing the ID keeps Flue's session scope stable. On Node.js, that session state lives in memory unless you wire up a custom store. These HTTP prompts remain attached until they complete; they advance an agent session and do not create workflow runs or return `runId`.

Render closes idle HTTP connections after about 100 seconds. Most prompt-and-response agents finish well inside that window, but if you build agents that run long tool chains or large multi-step prompts, use `POST /agents/:name/:id` without `?wait=result` and read the returned stream coordinates, or use a scheduled / background runner (see [Going further](#going-further)) instead of a single blocking request.

If you only need direct attached agent prompts or application webhook routes that dispatch inputs into in-memory sessions, you can stop here.

## 3. Review the web service config

Open the template's `render.yaml`. Its web service follows this shape:

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: flue-agents
    runtime: node
    plan: free
    buildCommand: npm ci && npx flue build --target node
    startCommand: node dist/server.mjs
    healthCheckPath: /health
    envVars:
      - key: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
        sync: false
```

This is the Render side of what the Node guide already covers:

- `buildCommand` compiles Flue's Node target.
- `startCommand` runs the generated server, which binds to `PORT` and serves workflows at `/workflows/<name>` and agents at `/agents/<name>/<id>`.
- `healthCheckPath` lets Render verify each deploy before it shifts traffic, provided your authored application exposes `/health` in `app.ts`.
- `sync: false` keeps the secret out of the Blueprint. Render prompts for the value on first deploy and stores it on the service.

If you ever move this setup into a different repo, drop the same `render.yaml` at its root, then create a new Blueprint from the Render Dashboard (**New > Blueprint**) and pick that repo.

## 4. Change model configuration

Provider keys belong in environment variables, either in the Render Dashboard or in `render.yaml` with `sync: false`. Common choices:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Anthropic.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI.
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for OpenRouter.

If your app reads a model specifier from the environment, set it next to the matching provider key:

```yaml
envVars:
  - key: MODEL_SPECIFIER
    value: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
  - key: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
    sync: false
```

Once the next deploy goes live, call the translation workflow again:

```bash
curl 'https://<service>.onrender.com/workflows/translate?wait=result' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Good morning", "language": "Spanish"}'
```

A successful response means the new env values reached the running service and Flue can still talk to the provider.

## 5. Add session persistence

In-memory sessions disappear on every deploy or restart, and they don't help once you scale beyond one instance. If your agents need conversations that survive that, back them with a Render data store using a `PersistenceAdapter`. See [Database](/docs/guide/database/) for `db.ts` and available adapters.

> **Starting fresh and want persistence built in?** Deploy the [Flue + Postgres template](https://render.com/templates/flue-with-postgresql) instead of the base template. It ships everything in this section preconfigured: a Render Postgres database wired into the web service via `DATABASE_URL` and a `db.ts` using `@flue/postgres`. The walkthrough below is for adding the same setup to a service you've already deployed from the base template.

Render Postgres is the best default for durable session history. Extend the template's `render.yaml` with a database and wire `DATABASE_URL` into the web service:

```yaml
databases:
  - name: flue-db
    plan: basic-256mb

services:
  - type: web
    name: flue-agents
    runtime: node
    plan: free
    buildCommand: npm ci && npx flue build --target node
    startCommand: node dist/server.mjs
    healthCheckPath: /health
    envVars:
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        fromDatabase:
          name: flue-db
          property: connectionString
      - key: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
        sync: false
```

Install the `@flue/postgres` adapter:

```bash
npm install @flue/postgres
```

Create a `db.ts` that reads `DATABASE_URL`:

```typescript title=".flue/db.ts"
import { postgres } from '@flue/postgres';

export default postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
```

Flue discovers `db.ts` at build time and wires it into the generated server entry. The adapter handles schema creation, session snapshots, and durable submission state automatically.

The `connectionString` from `fromDatabase` is Render's internal Postgres URL, which doesn't require SSL. If you ever swap to the external connection string, add `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }` to the `Pool` config.

To verify persistence end to end, run a fact-recall test that survives a process restart:

1. Commit the updated `render.yaml` and the new `SessionStore`, then wait for the database-aware deploy to go live.
2. Plant a fact in a fresh session:

   ```bash
   curl https://<service>.onrender.com/agents/assistant/persist-test \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Remember this number for me: 42."}'
   ```

3. Restart the service from the Render Dashboard (**Manual Deploy > Restart Service**) so the in-memory state of the previous process is gone.
4. Once the service is healthy, ask for the fact back:

   ```bash
   curl https://<service>.onrender.com/agents/assistant/persist-test \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "What number did I ask you to remember?"}'
   ```

If the response references `42`, your `SessionStore` is reading and writing through Postgres correctly. If the agent has no idea, persistence isn't being read on session resume.

## Going further

A few patterns this guide doesn't cover yet:

- **Scheduled workflows.** Some tasks are better modeled as periodic workflows than as inbound agent messages (nightly summaries, weekly reports, cache refreshes). Deploy them as a Render cron job whose `startCommand` is `npx flue run <workflow> --target node`. Each fire builds, runs the workflow once, and exits.
- **Queue-backed workers.** For continuous, queue-backed agent delivery, reach for a Render background worker. A worker can make an attached agent request and wait for its result, or application code can use `dispatch(...)` for asynchronous delivery identified by `dispatchId`. When Key Value is backing a queue, set `maxmemoryPolicy: noeviction` so jobs are never evicted.

## Troubleshooting

When a step doesn't behave as expected, run through these quick checks:

| Symptom                              | Check                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Health check fails                   | Make sure `startCommand` is `node dist/server.mjs` and that the build produced `dist/server.mjs`. |
| Agent call returns a provider error  | Confirm the matching provider key is set in the service's environment variables.                  |
| Build can't find `flue`              | Make sure `@flue/cli` is installed and available during the build or start command.               |
| Agent forgets context after a deploy | Wire up a custom `SessionStore` backed by Postgres or Key Value.                                  |
