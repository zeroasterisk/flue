title: Deploy Agents on Node.js
description: Build and deploy Flue agents as a Node.js server.
---

Build and deploy Flue agents as a Node.js server. This guide walks you through creating your first agent, running it locally, and deploying it anywhere you can run Node.js — a VPS, Docker, Railway, Fly.io, or any cloud platform.

By the end, you will have a Flue agent running as a Node.js server, and you will know how to add subagents, sandbox context, external CLIs, remote sandboxes, and durable session storage when your agent needs them.

This guide focuses on deploying the generated Node server. First review [Build & Deploy](/docs/guide/deployment/) for target selection and persistence boundaries, then see [Routing](/docs/guide/routing/) for direct HTTP/WebSocket agent delivery, workflow endpoints, and asynchronous `dispatch(...)` from application-owned routes.

## Project layout

The project root is your project directory. Source files (agents, workflows, and any other code they import) live in one of two places, analogous to Next.js's `src/` folder:

- `./agents/` and `./workflows/` — bare layout, source at the project root.
- `./.flue/agents/` and `./.flue/workflows/` — `.flue/` source layout. When you opt into this, treat `.flue/` as the home for everything agent-related (connectors, session stores, helpers, …).

If `./.flue/` exists, Flue reads sources from there; otherwise it reads from the project root. The two layouts never mix. By default `flue build` writes to `./dist/` at the project root; pass `--output <path>` to redirect the build elsewhere. Examples in this guide use the `./.flue/` layout — drop the prefix if you prefer the bare layout.

## Hello World

The simplest agent — no container, no storage, just a prompt and a typed result.

### 1. Set up your project

```bash
mkdir my-flue-server && cd my-flue-server
npm init -y
npm install @flue/runtime valibot
npm install -D @flue/cli
```

### 2. Create your first agent

`.flue/workflows/translate.ts`:

```typescript
import { createAgent, type FlueContext, type WorkflowRouteHandler } from '@flue/runtime';
import * as v from 'valibot';

export const route: WorkflowRouteHandler = async (_c, next) => next();

const translator = createAgent(() => ({ model: 'openai/gpt-5.5' }));

export async function run({ init, payload }: FlueContext) {
  const harness = await init(translator);
  const session = await harness.session();

  const { data } = await session.prompt(
    `Translate this to ${payload.language}: "${payload.text}"`,
    {
      result: v.object({
        translation: v.string(),
        confidence: v.picklist(['low', 'medium', 'high']),
      }),
    },
  );

  return data;
}
```

A few things to note:

- **`route`** — Export Hono middleware to expose this workflow via HTTP. It may perform authentication before calling `next()`.
- **`createAgent(...)` + `init(agent)`** — Created agents declare model and sandbox configuration; workflows initialize them when needed. `init(agent)` fails unless its created agent config provides a model, sets `model: false`, or supplies a profile with a model. By default, Flue gives initialized agents a virtual sandbox powered by [just-bash](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash). No container needed.
- **Schemas** — The [Valibot](https://valibot.dev) schema defines the expected output shape. Flue parses the agent's response and returns it on `response.data`, fully typed.

### 3. Add your API key

Put provider API keys in a `.env` file at the project root:

```bash
cat > .env <<'EOF'
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
EOF

printf '\n.env\n' >> .gitignore
```

Use the env var name your provider expects — `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Anthropic, and so on. Do not commit `.env`.

### 4. Build and run

For local development, `flue dev --target node --env .env` is the fastest path. It builds your project root, loads the env file, starts the server on port 3583, and watches for changes — edit an agent file, the server reloads automatically.

```bash
npx flue dev --target node --env .env
```

Test it:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3583/workflows/translate?wait=result' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello world", "language": "French"}'
```

The `?wait=result` mode keeps this request attached until the workflow completes and returns its result. Without it, an admitted HTTP workflow responds immediately with `202` and a `runId` for later inspection.

Every workflow that exports `route` gets an HTTP endpoint automatically. The middleware may authenticate the request and call `next()` to admit it. The route follows the pattern `/workflows/<name>` — for example, `.flue/workflows/translate.ts` becomes `/workflows/translate`.

For a one-shot production-style run (no watcher), use `flue build` + the generated server. The built server reads `process.env` directly, so source your env file in your shell or pass values explicitly:

```bash
npx flue build --target node
set -a; source .env; set +a
node dist/server.mjs
```

`flue build --target node` compiles your project into a `./dist` directory. The built server uses [Hono](https://hono.dev/) under the hood and listens on port 3000 by default (configurable via the `PORT` environment variable). Your project's `node_modules` are still needed at runtime — the build externalizes your dependencies rather than bundling them.

### WebSocket endpoints

Export WebSocket middleware to expose an agent or workflow through the generated server's WebSocket upgrade handling. For a workflow, import `type WorkflowWebSocketHandler` and export `const websocket: WorkflowWebSocketHandler = async (_c, next) => next();`; use `AgentWebSocketHandler` in an agent module. The middleware may authenticate the upgrade before calling `next()`. Agents use `GET /agents/:name/:id` and remain connected for sequential prompts; workflows use `GET /workflows/:name`, accept one invocation, return a result, and close.

```ts
import { createFlueClient } from '@flue/sdk';

const client = createFlueClient({ baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000' });
const chat = client.agents.connect('chat', 'customer-123');
await chat.ready;
console.log(await chat.prompt('Hello', { session: 'support' }));
chat.close();

const job = client.workflows.connect('translate');
await job.ready;
console.log(await job.invoke({ text: 'Hello', language: 'French' }));
```

An exported `websocket` middleware can authenticate its own agent or workflow socket endpoint. Custom `.flue/app.ts` applications provide centralized authentication and mounted prefixes: for example, apply `app.use('/api/agents/*', authenticate)` and `app.use('/api/workflows/*', authenticate)` before `app.route('/api', flue())` to cover both socket surfaces. SDK clients can connect through that mount with `websocketBasePath: '/api'` and can attach query-token or signed handshake context with `websocketUrl: (url) => { url.searchParams.set('token', socketToken); return url; }`. HTTP `token` and `headers` options do not automatically apply to WebSocket upgrades; browsers should use cookies or application-designed URL authentication, while Node clients requiring implementation-specific headers can supply a custom `websocket` factory. Avoid header-mutating middleware such as CORS wrapping WebSocket upgrade routes, because WebSocket upgrade responses may have immutable headers.

You can also invoke any workflow from the CLI without starting a server. `flue run` accepts the same `--env` flag:

```bash
npx flue run translate --target node --env .env \
  --payload '{"text": "Hello world", "language": "French"}'
```

## Subagents

Subagents define named delegates for detached task sessions:

```typescript
import { createAgent, defineAgentProfile } from '@flue/runtime';

const analyst = defineAgentProfile({
  name: 'analyst',
  instructions: 'Focus on quantitative insights, trends, and actionable takeaways.',
});
const reportAgent = createAgent(() => ({ model: 'openai/gpt-5.5', subagents: [analyst] }));

const harness = await init(reportAgent);
const session = await harness.session();
const analysis = await session.task("Analyze this quarter's metrics", { agent: 'analyst' });
```

## Sandbox context

The agent reads `AGENTS.md` and skills from its sandbox at runtime. With `local()`, that's your real project root, so any files there are visible. With the default virtual sandbox the filesystem starts empty — you'd set up context via `session.shell()` or skip these features for simple prompt-and-response agents.

**Skills** are reusable agent tasks defined as markdown files in `.agents/skills/`. They give the agent a focused instruction set for a specific job:

`.agents/skills/summarize/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: summarize
description: Summarize a document or text input.
---

Given the text provided in the arguments, produce a concise summary.
Focus on the key points and keep it to 2-3 sentences.
```

**`AGENTS.md`** at the root of the sandbox is the agent's system prompt — it provides global context about the project.

Call a skill from your agent:

```typescript
import * as v from 'valibot';

const { data } = await session.skill('summarize', {
  args: { text: document },
  result: v.object({ summary: v.string() }),
});
```

## Using the local sandbox

`local()` is where Node really shines compared to other targets. The agent runs directly against the host filesystem and shell — `cwd` is `process.cwd()`, shell commands go through `child_process`, and `AGENTS.md` and skills are discovered from the project root.

Run flue itself inside an isolation boundary you trust — a CI runner, a container, a sandbox VM. There is no second layer of isolation between the agent and the host.

Env exposure is opt-in. By default only shell essentials (`PATH`, `HOME`, locale, etc.) are inherited from `process.env`; anything else — API keys, tokens, deploy credentials — has to be passed explicitly via `local({ env: { ... } })`. That keeps the model's `bash` tool from seeing host secrets by accident.

`.flue/workflows/reviewer.ts`:

```typescript
import { createAgent, type FlueContext, type WorkflowRouteHandler } from '@flue/runtime';
import { local } from '@flue/runtime/node';
import * as v from 'valibot';

export const route: WorkflowRouteHandler = async (_c, next) => next();

const reviewer = createAgent(() => ({ sandbox: local(), model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6' }));

export async function run({ init, payload }: FlueContext) {
  const harness = await init(reviewer);
  const session = await harness.session();

  const { data } = await session.prompt(
    `Review the codebase and identify potential issues in the area
    related to: ${payload.topic}`,
    {
      result: v.object({
        issues: v.array(
          v.object({
            file: v.string(),
            line: v.optional(v.number()),
            severity: v.picklist(['low', 'medium', 'high']),
            description: v.string(),
          }),
        ),
        summary: v.string(),
      }),
    },
  );

  return data;
}
```

The agent reads, searches, and modifies files via its built-in tools — read, write, edit, grep, glob, bash. Anything on `$PATH` (`git`, `npm`, `gh`, `docker`) is reachable from the bash tool. Env vars are opt-in via `local({ env: { ... } })` — pass `process.env.GH_TOKEN`, `process.env.NPM_TOKEN`, etc. into the sandbox for the binaries that need them.

### When to use it

- **Self-hosted coding agents** — review PRs, fix bugs, refactor against the actual repo.
- **File processing** — read documents, transform data, generate reports from local files.
- **Dev tooling** — analyze project structure, run linters, generate boilerplate.
- **CI** — issue triage, deploy checks, anything where the runner already provides isolation.

No container startup, real project context, fast iteration. If you need a tighter boundary on a specific operation — agent can call it, never sees the underlying secret — wrap it as a custom tool via `createAgent(() => ({ tools: [...] }))`. The tool reads `process.env`; the agent only sees the tool's params and result.

## Connecting a remote sandbox

The examples above use either the default virtual sandbox or the local sandbox. When you need full isolation per session — each user gets their own Linux environment with git, Node.js, Python, etc. — you want a remote sandbox.

Flue connects to remote sandboxes through small adapter files called connectors, installed with `flue add`. Run `flue add` with no arguments to see what's currently supported, or `flue add <url> --category sandbox` to have your coding agent build a connector for an unsupported provider against the [sandbox connector spec](https://github.com/withastro/flue/blob/main/docs/sandbox-connector-spec.md).

The Ecosystem catalog lists available provider integrations, including [Daytona](/docs/ecosystem/sandboxes/daytona/), [E2B](/docs/ecosystem/sandboxes/e2b/), [Modal](/docs/ecosystem/sandboxes/modal/), and [Vercel Sandbox](/docs/ecosystem/sandboxes/vercel/). Other connectors follow the same application-owned lifecycle shape.

### When to use a remote sandbox

| Local / virtual sandbox        | Remote sandbox                              |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Millisecond startup            | Seconds to start (cached images are faster) |
| Shares host filesystem (local) | Fully isolated per session                  |
| No per-session isolation       | Each user gets their own environment        |
| Great for single-tenant / CI   | Great for multi-tenant / SaaS               |

Start with the local or virtual sandbox. Move to a remote sandbox when you need per-session isolation.

## Session persistence

On Node.js, session state is stored in memory by default — sessions persist for the lifetime of the process but are lost on restart. This is fine for development and stateless workloads.

For durable sessions, return a custom store via the `persist` option from `createAgent(...)`. A store implements three methods — `save()`, `load()`, and `delete()` — each operating on a session ID and a `SessionData` object (message history, metadata, compaction state):

```typescript
import { createAgent, type FlueContext, type SessionStore, type SessionData } from '@flue/runtime';
import { local } from '@flue/runtime/node';

// Example: a simple file-backed store. In production, use a database.
const store: SessionStore = {
  async save(id: string, data: SessionData) {
    /* write to DB */
  },
  async load(id: string) {
    /* read from DB, return null if not found */
  },
  async delete(id: string) {
    /* delete from DB */
  },
};

const assistant = createAgent(() => ({
  sandbox: local(),
  persist: store,
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6',
}));

export async function run({ init, payload }: FlueContext) {
  const harness = await init(assistant);
  const session = await harness.session();
  // ...
}
```

You can back this with any database: SQLite, Postgres, Redis, etc.

## Building and deploying

Flue compiles your project into a Node.js server:

```bash
# Build
npx flue build --target node

# Run locally
node dist/server.mjs

# Run on a custom port
PORT=8080 node dist/server.mjs
```

The default root-mounted Flue application can expose:

- `POST /agents/:name/:id` — send an attached prompt to an agent module that exports `route`;
- `POST /workflows/:name` — invoke a workflow module that exports `route`;
- `WS /agents/:name/:id` — connect to an agent module that exports `websocket`;
- `WS /workflows/:name` — invoke a workflow module that exports `websocket` once;
- `GET /runs/:runId` and related event/stream paths — inspect workflow runs.

Flue does not add a health endpoint or administrative agent listing by default. Define a host-required health route in `app.ts`, and mount `admin()` separately behind operator authorization if deployment-wide inspection is required. Agent prompt routes advance sessions without creating runs; workflow invocations are the executions represented by workflow run IDs and inspectable through run tooling.

### Deploying with Docker

```dockerfile
FROM node:22-slim
WORKDIR /app
# The build externalizes your dependencies, so node_modules
# are needed at runtime.
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci --production
COPY dist/ ./dist/
ENV PORT=8080
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["node", "dist/server.mjs"]
```

```bash
docker build -t my-flue-server .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... my-flue-server
```

### Deploying elsewhere

The output is just a Node.js server, so it runs anywhere:

- **systemd / PM2** — `pm2 start dist/server.mjs`
- **Railway / Render** — Point the start command at `node dist/server.mjs`
- **Fly.io** — Use the Dockerfile above with `fly launch`
- **AWS / GCP / Azure** — Deploy as a container or directly on a VM

### Choosing a sandbox strategy

Here's the progression of sandbox types available on Node.js, from simplest to most powerful:

1. **Empty virtual sandbox** — `createAgent(() => ({ model: 'openai/gpt-5.5' }))`. Fast, cheap, stateless. Good for prompt-and-response agents.
2. **Virtual sandbox with shell setup** — Use `session.shell()` to write files and configure the workspace. Still fast and cheap, good for agents that need small amounts of static context.
3. **Local sandbox** — `createAgent(() => ({ sandbox: local(), model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6' }))`. Direct host filesystem and shell access. Ideal for self-hosted agents, CI tasks, and dev tooling — anywhere the host environment already provides isolation. Import `local` from `@flue/runtime/node` and pass `env: { ... }` to expose specific host env vars to the agent's shell.
4. **Remote sandbox** — Full isolated Linux environment via a sandbox connector. For multi-tenant agents, coding sandboxes, and anything that needs per-session isolation.

Start simple. Move up when you need to.
