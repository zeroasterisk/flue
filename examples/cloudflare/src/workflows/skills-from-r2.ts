/**
 * Demonstrates the `getShellSandbox` + `hydrateFromBucket` flow for
 * hydrating a cf-shell Workspace from an R2 bucket.
 *
 * What this shows:
 *   1. Construct a default Workspace for the agent instance.
 *   2. On first run, copy the bucket's contents into the Workspace (so
 *      `/.agents/skills/spam-filter/SKILL.md` lives at that path on the
 *      workspace filesystem). Subsequent runs short-circuit on the
 *      `/.hydrated` sentinel.
 *   3. Wire the Workspace into a cf-shell sandbox; pass it to `init()`.
 *   4. Call a skill the agent discovered from the hydrated filesystem.
 *
 * Bucket layout: any object whose key under the bucket starts with
 * `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` becomes a registered skill. We pass
 * `prefix: ''` (the default) so the bucket's full key tree is mirrored
 * verbatim into the workspace.
 *
 * Local development: Worker Loader is in beta and `wrangler dev`'s
 * local mode doesn't yet simulate the `worker_loaders` binding. To run
 * this example, use either:
 *   - `wrangler dev --remote` (runs against Cloudflare's edge; requires
 *     Worker Loader access on your account), or
 *   - `wrangler deploy` to a preview environment.
 * See the example's README.md for the full setup, the seed-r2.sh helper,
 * and the fallback options if you don't have Loader access.
