/**
 * Tests cross-invocation session persistence.
 *
 * The agent instance id comes from the URL (routed by the platform).
 * Two requests to the same agent instance id share the default harness/session history.
 *
 * Payload:
 *   { "action": "set" }    — store a secret in the session
 *   { "action": "recall" } — ask the agent to recall it
 *
 * This is a multi-invocation test — it requires a running server (not flue run).
 * Example:
 *   curl -X POST localhost:3000/agents/session-test/s1 -d '{"action":"set"}'
 *   curl -X POST localhost:3000/agents/session-test/s1 -d '{"action":"recall"}'
 *
 * Note to maintainers:
 * This is a pain to test, so only run this as a test if you need the extra level of confidence,
 * if you were recently changing code that impacted sessions/persistence, or were doing a larger
 * refactor. Otherwise, this test is safe to skip and not run as part of your regular test suite.
