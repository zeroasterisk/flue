# Add a libSQL Database to Flue

You are an AI coding agent configuring libSQL-backed persistence for a Flue
project using the first-party `@flue/libsql` adapter. Use this for a local
SQLite file, a self-hosted libSQL server (`sqld`), or an embedded replica. For
hosted Turso, use the `turso` blueprint instead — it is the same package with a
different client configuration.

This gives the project's agent sessions, accepted submissions, and workflow-run
records durable state. It does not store the application's own business data —
keep customer records, tickets, and payments in your application's tables.

## Check the target first

A `db.ts` adapter is a **Node-target** concern. The Cloudflare target uses
Durable Object SQLite automatically and rejects `db.ts` at build time. If this
project targets Cloudflare, stop and tell the user — there is nothing to add.

## Inspect the project

Read local instructions (`AGENTS.md` and similar), detect the package manager,
and select the first existing source root: `<root>/.flue/`, then `<root>/src/`,
then `<root>/`. Check for an existing `db.ts` — if one is present, the project
already has an adapter; confirm with the user before replacing it. Inspect how
the project reads secrets.

Install `@flue/libsql` and the official [`@libsql/client`](https://docs.turso.tech/sdk/ts/reference)
with the project's package manager. `@flue/libsql` does not bundle a driver.

## Create `db.ts`

Write `<source-dir>/db.ts` with a default-exported adapter that wraps the
client in the runner shape — `query` (a SQL string with `?` placeholders plus
positional params, resolving to result rows), a `transaction` that runs its
callback in one `write` transaction, and `close`. `@libsql/client` returns a
`ResultSet`, so map its `rows`/`columns` into plain objects:

```ts title="src/db.ts"
import { libsql } from '@flue/libsql';
import { createClient, type ResultSet } from '@libsql/client';

// Local file: `file:./data/flue.db`
// Self-hosted libSQL server (sqld): `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
const client = createClient({ url: process.env.LIBSQL_URL! });

const toRows = (rs: ResultSet) =>
  rs.rows.map((row) => Object.fromEntries(rs.columns.map((column) => [column, row[column]])));

let tail: Promise<unknown> = Promise.resolve();
const serialize = <T>(operation: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> => {
  const result = tail.then(operation, operation);
  tail = result.then(() => undefined, () => undefined);
  return result;
};

export default libsql({
  query: (text, params = []) =>
    serialize(async () => toRows(await client.execute({ sql: text, args: params }))),
  transaction: (fn) =>
    serialize(async () => {
      const tx = await client.transaction('write');
      try {
        const result = await fn({
          query: async (text, params = []) =>
            toRows(await tx.execute({ sql: text, args: params })),
        });
        await tx.commit();
        return result;
      } catch (error) {
        await tx.rollback();
        throw error;
      } finally {
        tx.close();
      }
    }),
  close: () => client.close(),
});
```

Do not hardcode a connection string, and do not invent one — `LIBSQL_URL` (or
the project's existing equivalent) is supplied by the environment.

Flue discovers `db.ts` at build time and wires the default export into the
generated Node server. The adapter's `migrate()` hook runs automatically at
startup and creates its tables idempotently, so there is no separate migration
step. Do not add an `app.ts` solely to register the database.

When `LIBSQL_URL` points at a local `file:` database, asynchronous writes can
otherwise overlap and return `SQLITE_BUSY`. Keep the shared promise chain in the
runner so top-level queries and transactions from this process are serialized.
This does not provide multi-process or multi-tenant write coordination; use a
libSQL server or hosted Turso for that deployment shape.

## Credentials

The client reads its connection target (and any auth token) at runtime. Follow
the project's secret conventions and never commit real values. For local
development, `flue dev --env <file>` and `flue run --env <file>` load any
`.env`-format file. Update existing environment documentation or `.env.example`
when the project keeps one.

## Verify

1. Typecheck the project (`npx tsc --noEmit` is safe).
2. Build the project's configured Node target and confirm the adapter is
   discovered and wired into the generated server.
3. With `LIBSQL_URL` set (a local `file:` database is fine), start the server
   and confirm it boots — `migrate()` creates the `flue_*` tables on first run.
   Restart it and confirm existing state is reloaded rather than recreated.
4. Do not point the adapter at a production database to test.
