# Flue Connectors

This directory holds the source-of-truth markdown files for all Flue
connectors served at `https://flueframework.com/cli/connectors/<slug>.md`
and pulled into user projects via `flue add <name>`.

A connector is **a markdown file with installation instructions for an AI
coding agent**, not an npm package. The CLI is a fetch-and-print pipe; the
agent does the file-writing.

## Supported categories

| Category   | Status    | Notes                                                          |
| ---------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sandbox`  | Supported | Adapts remote execution providers to Flue's sandbox contract.  |
| `channel`  | Supported | Adds verified provider ingress, an SDK client, and app tools.  |
| `database` | Supported | Adapts a database backend to Flue's `PersistenceAdapter` via a `db.ts`. |

> **Please don't open PRs introducing new categories.** Adding a category
> requires CLI/runtime changes and a long-term maintenance commitment from
> the Flue team. New _connectors_ inside an existing supported category are
> welcome — see "Adding a new connector" below.

## File naming

Connectors use a `<category>--<name>.md` filename convention. Category roots
(generic instructions for a category) use the bare `<category>.md` filename.

```
connectors/
  sandbox.md                 # Generic instructions for the "sandbox" category.
                             # Addressable as: flue add <url> --category sandbox
                             # The CLI substitutes the user-provided URL into
                             # the markdown's {{URL}} placeholder before piping.
  sandbox--daytona.md        # The Daytona sandbox connector.
                             # Addressable as: flue add daytona
```

The double-dash separator is used so that providers whose names contain
single dashes (e.g. `cloud-run`, `fly-io`) don't conflict with the
category boundary.

## Slug derivation

The CLI's prebuild script (`packages/cli/scripts/generate-connector-index.ts`)
derives slugs:

- `<category>--<name>.md` → slug `<name>`
- `<category>.md` (with `"root": true`) → not addressable as a connector
  slug; only via `flue add <url> --category <category>`

If two files would resolve to the same slug, the prebuild script errors out.

## Frontmatter (JSON, not YAML)

Every connector markdown file begins with a JSON frontmatter block fenced by
`---` lines. The CLI parses it with `JSON.parse()` — no YAML dependency.

For category roots:

```markdown
---
{ 'category': 'sandbox', 'root': true }
---
```

For named connectors:

```markdown
---
{ 'category': 'sandbox', 'website': 'https://daytona.io' }
---
```

Fields:

| Field      | Type     | Required when         | Description                                                               |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `category` | string   | always                | Connector category. Must be one of the supported categories listed above. |
| `website`  | string   | named connectors only | Provider's homepage. Shown in `flue add` listing                          |
| `aliases`  | string[] | optional              | Additional names users can pass to `flue add`. See "Aliases" below        |
| `root`     | boolean  | category roots only   | Must be `true`. Marks file as the category root                           |

The website strips frontmatter when serving the markdown — agents and humans
see clean content.

### Aliases

`aliases` lets a connector be addressable by names beyond its canonical slug.
For example, `sandbox--vercel.md` declares `"aliases": ["@vercel/sandbox"]`,
so `flue add @vercel/sandbox` and `flue add vercel` both resolve to the same
connector. The canonical slug is still what the listing UI advertises and
what the registry URL is keyed on; aliases are purely a convenience for
users who'd otherwise type a more specific name.

**Use aliases sparingly.** They're reserved for cases where the canonical
brand name is genuinely ambiguous because the company has multiple products
(e.g. Vercel does hosting, sandboxes, and databases — `vercel` alone doesn't
say which one). Don't add aliases for synonyms, marketing variants, or
spelling preferences.

The prebuild script enforces uniqueness: an alias can't collide with another
connector's slug or another connector's alias. CLI lookups are
case-insensitive against both slugs and aliases, so you don't need to add
casing variants.

## Body conventions

The body is the prompt an AI coding agent will read and act on. Follow the
conventions for its category rather than forcing all connector types into one
template.

### Sandbox bodies

The existing `sandbox--daytona.md` and `sandbox--vercel.md` files are the
template. Match their structure unless the provider genuinely requires
something different.

For reference, the shape they share:

1. A single sentence framing what the connector is and that the reader is
   an AI agent installing it.
2. **What this connector does** — one paragraph, "wraps an
   already-initialized X into Flue's `SandboxFactory`; user owns the
   provider lifecycle".
3. **Where to write the file** — be explicit about source-directory selection
   (`<root>/.flue/`, then `<root>/src/`, then `<root>/`) and tell the agent to
   write under `<source-dir>/connectors/` or ask if unsure.
4. **The full TypeScript file content** in a code block, ready to write
   verbatim. Don't include placeholders the agent has to fill in.
5. **Required dependencies** — what the agent should `npm install`.
6. **Authentication** — how the provider authenticates (env var, OIDC,
   OAuth, certs, etc.), where credentials should live, and a note never
   to invent values. The shape of this section will vary the most between
   providers; let the provider's actual auth model drive it.
7. **Wiring it into an agent** — a usage snippet for one of the user's
   agents.
8. **Verify** — typecheck + manual next-steps for the user, ending with
   `flue dev` / `flue run <workflow>`.

For category-root files (e.g. `sandbox.md`), instead of a verbatim TS file,
point the agent at the spec doc on raw GitHub plus a known-good reference
connector (e.g. `daytona`).

### Channel bodies

Channel recipes create editable project integration source rather than a
universal adapter. They should:

1. Inspect the target, source root, app entrypoint, agents, environment types,
   and secret conventions.
2. Install the first-party ingress package when one exists and the provider's
   established outbound SDK or a narrow Fetch client when the SDK is not
   cross-platform.
3. Create `channels/<provider>.ts` with named `channel` and `client` exports.
4. Use constructor-owned verified callbacks and exact default path comments.
5. Show optional unused protocol surfaces commented out.
6. Dispatch only normalized provider input and stable delivery identity.
7. Define only application-requested tools, with trusted destinations bound
   outside model arguments.
8. Verify with local signed payloads and the project's actual build target.

Channel recipes must not imply a common provider client API, install generic
tool collections, or add `app.ts` solely to mount a discovered channel.

### Database bodies

Database connectors produce a single source-root `db.ts` that default-exports a
`PersistenceAdapter`, not a file under `connectors/`. Two shapes exist:

- **Named connectors with a first-party package** (e.g. `database--postgres.md`)
  install the maintained `@flue/<backend>` adapter and write the small `db.ts`
  that reads its connection string from the environment. These are short:
  check the target, inspect the project, install, write `db.ts`, verify.
- **The category root** (`database.md`) is for backends with no first-party
  package. Instead of a verbatim file, it points the agent at the
  `PersistenceAdapter` spec on the website plus the Postgres connector as a
  worked example, and tells it to implement the contract against the backend's
  real primitives.

Database bodies must state that a `db.ts` adapter is a Node-target concern (the
Cloudflare target uses Durable Object SQLite and rejects `db.ts`), must read
connection strings from the environment rather than inventing them, and must
not store application business data in the adapter.

## Adding a new connector

1. Create `connectors/<category>--<name>.md` with the JSON frontmatter and
   instructions for the agent.
2. Run the CLI prebuild (`pnpm --filter @flue/cli build`) to regenerate
   `packages/cli/bin/_connectors.generated.ts` and validate frontmatter.
3. Confirm the file is served correctly via the local website
   (`pnpm --filter @flue/www dev`) at
   `http://localhost:4321/cli/connectors/<name>.md`.
4. Try it end-to-end: pipe `flue add <name>` to a coding agent in a sample
   project and confirm the agent successfully installs the connector.
