# Add a Turso Database to Flue

You are an AI coding agent configuring hosted [Turso](https://turso.tech)
persistence for a Flue project using the first-party `@flue/libsql` adapter.
Turso is hosted libSQL; this is the same adapter as the `libsql` blueprint with
a Turso client configuration. For a local file or self-hosted libSQL server,
use the `libsql` blueprint instead.

This gives the project's agent sessions, accepted submissions, and workflow-run
records durable state that survives process restart and is shared across
replicas. It does not store the application's own business data — keep customer
records, tickets, and payments in your application's tables.

## Check the target first

A `db.ts` adapter is a **Node-target** concern. The Cloudflare target uses
Durable Object SQLite automatically and rejects `db.ts` at build time. If this
project targets Cloudflare, stop and tell the user — there is nothing to add.

## Inspect the project

Read local instructions (`AGENTS.md` and similar), detect the package manager,
and select the first existing source root: `<root>/.flue/`, then `<root>/src/`,
then `<root>/`. Check for an existing `db.ts` — if one is present, the project
already has an adapter; confirm with the user before replacing it. Inspect how
the project reads secrets.

Install `@flue/libsql` and the official [`@libsql/client`](https://docs.turso.tech/sdk/ts/reference)
with the project's package manager. `@flue/libsql` does not bundle a driver.

The user creates the database and an auth token with the
[Turso CLI](https://docs.turso.tech/cli/introduction) (`turso db create`,
`turso db show --url`, `turso db tokens create`). Never invent these values.

## Create `db.ts`

Write `<source-dir>/db.ts` with a default-exported adapter that wraps the Turso
client in the runner shape — `query` (a SQL string with `?` placeholders plus
positional params, resolving to result rows), a `transaction` that runs its
callback in one `write` transaction, and `close`. `@libsql/client` returns a
`ResultSet`, so map its `rows`/`columns` into plain objects:

```ts title="src/db.ts"
import { libsql } from '@flue/libsql';
import { createClient, type ResultSet } from '@libsql/client';

const client = createClient({
  url: process.env.TURSO_DATABASE_URL!,
  authToken: process.env.TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN!,
});

const toRows = (rs: ResultSet) =>
  rs.rows.map((row) => Object.fromEntries(rs.columns.map((column) => [column, row[column]])));

export default libsql({
  query: async (text, params = []) =>
    toRows(await client.execute({ sql: text, args: params })),
  transaction: async (fn) => {
    const tx = await client.transaction('write');
    try {
      const result = await fn({
        query: async (text, params = []) =>
          toRows(await tx.execute({ sql: text, args: params })),
      });
      await tx.commit();
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      await tx.rollback();
      throw error;
    } finally {
      tx.close();
    }
  },
  close: () => client.close(),
});
```

Do not hardcode the URL or token, and do not invent them — `TURSO_DATABASE_URL`
(a `libsql://` URL) and `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` come from the environment. Turso
serializes writes server-side, so there is no embedded-file concurrency concern.

For lower read latency, the project can use a Turso **embedded replica** — a
local file synced from the remote database — by adding `syncUrl` and a local
`file:` `url`. Suggest this only if the user asks about read latency; the plain
remote client above is the default.

Flue discovers `db.ts` at build time and wires the default export into the
generated Node server. The adapter's `migrate()` hook runs automatically at
startup and creates its tables idempotently, so there is no separate migration
step. Do not add an `app.ts` solely to register the database.

## Credentials

The client reads `TURSO_DATABASE_URL` and `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` at runtime. Follow
the project's secret conventions and never commit real values. For local
development, `flue dev --env <file>` and `flue run --env <file>` load any
`.env`-format file. Update existing environment documentation or `.env.example`
when the project keeps one.

## Verify

1. Typecheck the project (`npx tsc --noEmit` is safe).
2. Build the project's configured Node target and confirm the adapter is
   discovered and wired into the generated server.
3. With `TURSO_DATABASE_URL` and `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` set (a development database
   is fine), start the server and confirm it boots — `migrate()` creates the
   `flue_*` tables on first run. Restart it and confirm existing state is
   reloaded rather than recreated.
4. Do not point the adapter at a production database to test.
