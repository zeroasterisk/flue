# Add a Postgres Database to Flue

You are an AI coding agent configuring Postgres-backed persistence for a Flue
project using the first-party `@flue/postgres` adapter.

This gives the project's agent sessions, accepted submissions, and workflow-run
records durable state that survives process restart and is shared across
replicas. It does not store the application's own business data — keep customer
records, tickets, and payments in your application's tables.

## Check the target first

A `db.ts` adapter is a **Node-target** concern. The Cloudflare target uses
Durable Object SQLite automatically and rejects `db.ts` at build time. If this
project targets Cloudflare, stop and tell the user — there is nothing to add.

## Inspect the project

Read local instructions (`AGENTS.md` and similar), detect the package manager,
and select the first existing source root: `<root>/.flue/`, then `<root>/src/`,
then `<root>/`. Check for an existing `db.ts` in that root — if one is present,
the project already has an adapter; confirm with the user before replacing it.
Inspect how the project reads secrets so the connection string follows the same
convention.

## Choose and install a driver

`@flue/postgres` does **not** bundle a database driver. It runs against a small
runner you wrap around the Postgres driver the project chooses, so the project
owns driver selection, pooling, TLS, and every connection option.

Install `@flue/postgres` plus one Postgres driver. If the project already
depends on a Postgres driver, reuse it. Otherwise pick the maintained driver
that fits — common choices are [`postgres`](https://github.com/porsager/postgres)
(porsager) and [`pg`](https://node-postgres.com/) (node-postgres). Ask the user
if the choice is consequential for their deployment.

## Create `db.ts`

Write `<source-dir>/db.ts` with a default-exported adapter that wraps the chosen
driver in the runner shape — `query` (a SQL string with numbered `$N`
placeholders plus positional params, resolving to result rows), a `transaction`
that runs its callback inside one transaction on a single connection, and
`close`.

Using the porsager `postgres` driver:

```ts title="src/db.ts"
import { postgres, type PostgresQuery } from '@flue/postgres';
import sql from 'postgres';

const db = sql(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);

export default postgres({
  query: (text, params) => db.unsafe(text, params),
  transaction: <T>(fn: (tx: { query: PostgresQuery }) => Promise<T>) =>
    db.begin((tx) => fn({ query: (text, params) => tx.unsafe(text, params) })) as Promise<T>,
  close: () => db.end(),
});
```

With `pg` (node-postgres), `transaction` must check out a single client and
issue `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` itself — a pool cannot run a transaction
across arbitrary connections:

```ts title="src/db.ts"
import { postgres } from '@flue/postgres';
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });

export default postgres({
  query: async (text, params) => (await pool.query(text, params)).rows,
  transaction: async (fn) => {
    const client = await pool.connect();
    try {
      await client.query('BEGIN');
      const result = await fn({ query: async (t, p) => (await client.query(t, p)).rows });
      await client.query('COMMIT');
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      await client.query('ROLLBACK');
      throw error;
    } finally {
      client.release();
    }
  },
  close: () => pool.end(),
});
```

Do not hardcode a connection string, and do not invent one — `DATABASE_URL` (or
the project's existing equivalent) is supplied by the environment.

Flue discovers `db.ts` at build time and wires the default export into the
generated Node server. The adapter's `migrate()` hook runs automatically at
startup and creates its tables idempotently, so there is no separate migration
step to run. Do not add an `app.ts` solely to register the database.

## Credentials

The driver reads `DATABASE_URL` at runtime. Follow the project's secret
conventions and never commit a real connection string. For local development,
`flue dev --env <file>` and `flue run --env <file>` load any `.env`-format file.
Update existing environment documentation or `.env.example` when the project
keeps one; don't introduce a new secret-management convention without need.

## Verify

1. Typecheck the project (`npx tsc --noEmit` is safe).
2. Build the project's configured Node target and confirm the adapter is
   discovered and wired into the generated server.
3. With `DATABASE_URL` pointed at a reachable Postgres (a local container is
   fine), start the server and confirm it boots — `migrate()` creates the
   `flue_*` tables on first run. Restart it and confirm existing state is
   reloaded rather than recreated.
4. Do not point the adapter at a production database to test.
