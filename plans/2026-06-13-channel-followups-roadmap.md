# Channel Follow-Ups Roadmap

## Status

The ten-provider first-party channel plan is implemented and audited. This
document records release work, deferred product decisions, and candidate
expansions without reopening the completed ingress design.

Scope decisions confirmed after implementation:

- channel examples prove Node and Cloudflare compatibility; they are not
  turnkey deployment projects and do not own Wrangler migration history;
- provider installation, credentials, webhook registration, and outbound
  behavior are developer-owned application concerns, not future channel-core
  work;
- long-lived transports are unsupported for now; a provider that requires one
  is ineligible until Flue intentionally adds that transport class;
- recurring conformance work should be captured as an agent skill, not a
  repository script.

## Principles

- Preserve the current ownership boundary: Flue owns verified ingress,
  provider identity, protocol responses, and routing; applications own SDK
  clients, credentials, tools, and broad outbound behavior.
- End the first-party channel responsibility at successful HTTP webhook
  receipt and response. App installation and lifecycle management remain
  outside the core even when a provider commonly pairs them with webhooks.
- Require Node and Cloudflare Workers execution for every canonical path.
- Add provider-specific behavior only when official protocol semantics justify
  it. Do not introduce a universal event schema, outbound client, or tool set.
- Do not add a provider whose useful ingress requires a socket, polling loop,
  or other long-lived process under the current channel model.
- Continue using primary provider sources and original synthetic fixtures.

## 1. Release The Completed Channels

This is the immediate next milestone.

- Choose the release version and publish the ten `@flue/*` channel packages
  together with the runtime and CLI changes they require.
- Deploy `apps/www` so the public connector registry serves all ten named
  recipes before announcing `flue add <provider>`.
- Publish the updated documentation and verify every public guide, API page,
  and connector markdown URL.
- Repeat the packed-artifact consumer check against the actual published
  versions.

Release exit criteria:

- every package is installable from the registry;
- every public `flue add` command returns the intended recipe;
- Node and Cloudflare examples build from published artifacts;
- no guide points at an unpublished package or undeployed connector.

The existing missing-Durable-Object-migration warning is not a channel release
blocker. These examples are compatibility and integration fixtures, not
deployment-ready Wrangler projects, and the channel plans never committed to
owning deployment migration history.

## 2. Capture Channel Conformance As An Agent Skill

The final audit required judgment as well as commands, so it should not become
another repository-owned script.

- Add a repository agent skill for researching, implementing, auditing, and
  releasing one first-party HTTP channel.
- Teach the skill to inspect the current provider package and example set
  rather than relying on a hard-coded list.
- Let the skill delegate independent provider research, package review,
  workerd review, docs review, and artifact inspection to subagents when useful.
- Require delegated subagents not to spawn their own subagents.
- Require the implementing agent to reconcile subagent findings and retain
  responsibility for final correctness.
- Include package build, strict types, Node tests, workerd tests, Node and
  Cloudflare example builds, fake outbound transports, packed artifacts, clean
  consumers, connector output, documentation consistency, and focused security
  review.
- Keep provider protocol assertions in provider suites. The skill should
  orchestrate and audit durable public contracts, not duplicate them in a
  generic test harness.

## 3. Core Non-Goals

The following are intentionally outside the first-party channel core:

- app, bot, account, and marketplace installation flows;
- OAuth callbacks, consent, credential encryption, refresh, rotation, and
  revocation;
- tenant or workspace credential lookup;
- webhook registration, renewal, and unregistration;
- broad outbound provider APIs, tools, rich UI builders, uploads, history, and
  search;
- application authorization policy and provider-backed idempotency claims;
- multi-tenant installation orchestration.

Examples and connector guides may explain the minimum configuration needed to
receive a webhook, but Flue should not grow core abstractions for these
application responsibilities. Conversation keys remain identifiers, never
authorization capabilities.

## 4. Expand Existing HTTP Surfaces Only From Concrete Demand

Expand packages only when verified ingress normalization or provider response
semantics require package work. Keep outbound behavior in project-owned
clients and tools.

- Slack: richer HTTP event families and attachment metadata.
- Discord: richer HTTP interaction families and command registration guidance.
- Teams: additional HTTP activity families and file-card metadata that arrives
  directly in verified activity payloads.
- Google Chat: Workspace Events subscription lifecycle, cards, reactions, and
  other verified HTTP event families.
- Linear: broader issue and project events plus agent-activity policy examples.
- Telegram: additional webhook Update families, typing, and media examples.
- WhatsApp: additional incoming message, status, media, Flow callback, and edit
  semantics when Meta documents a stable protocol.
- Twilio: add Messaging webhook families only; treat Voice, Conversations, and
  Verify as separate provider-channel research.
- Messenger: additional incoming webhook families only after concrete demand.

## 5. Research New First-Party Channels

Each candidate starts with the same clean-room provider process. It is eligible
only when its useful inbound integration fits stateless HTTP webhook receipt
and has a defensible Node and Cloudflare Workers path. Defer it immediately if
it requires a long-lived transport, provider-managed process, Node-only
runtime, or installation system inside Flue core.

### Stripe

High priority because the channel API was originally shaped around Stripe's
verified event construction model and Stripe webhooks are common agent
triggers.

- Verify the current Stripe SDK's exact request-byte verification path in
  workerd.
- Support a fixed `/webhook` route with typed `Stripe.Event` delivery if the
  official SDK executes on both targets.
- Keep all Stripe API operations and tools project-owned through the exported
  SDK client.

### Inbound Email / Resend

High priority for support, sales, and operations agents. Vercel's public adapter
directory highlights inbound email through Resend as a useful platform class.

- Research Resend inbound email webhook verification, batching, attachment
  retrieval, retries, and canonical thread identity.
- Prefer the official Fetch-based client if it passes workerd.
- Treat outbound email composition and reply policy as project-owned behavior.

### Notion

- Confirm the current webhook verification, supported event families, retry
  behavior, workspace identity, and resource identity.
- Ship only if useful inbound behavior works with developer-owned OAuth and
  installation state.

### Shopify

- Research webhook HMAC verification, topic and shop identity, retry behavior,
  API versioning, batching, and stable resource identity.
- Keep app installation, access tokens, and outbound Admin API behavior
  developer-owned.

### Intercom

- Research webhook verification, workspace identity, delivery retries, event
  families, and stable conversation or ticket identity.
- Do not take ownership of app installation, OAuth, inbox policy, or outbound
  support operations.

### Zendesk

- Research webhook authenticity, account identity, ticket and conversation
  event semantics, retries, and any provider-required response behavior.
- Defer if a trustworthy inbound path requires a long-lived integration
  service rather than developer-owned setup plus stateless webhooks.

Research these one at a time. A provider being popular is not enough to relax
the HTTP, clean-room, or Cloudflare gates.

### Stripe implementation — 2026-06-13

Status:

- Complete.

Primary sources:

- Stripe webhook, signature, retry, event-destination, Connect, context,
  Checkout fulfillment, Billing webhook, and Issuing authorization docs.
- Official `stripe-node` v22.2.1 research plus the v22.2.0 package metadata,
  source, declarations, and
  Worker exports.
- Current Cloudflare Workers Fetch, Web Crypto, package-condition, and
  workerd-testing documentation.

Clean-room affirmation:

- The design and future fixtures derive from Stripe's primary specifications
  and original synthetic payloads. No third-party adapter implementation,
  types, fixtures, payloads, snapshots, or tests are being copied or
  translated.

Eligibility:

- Eligible for ordinary stateless HTTPS event destinations.
- The official Stripe SDK has explicit `workerd` exports, uses Fetch and Web
  Crypto there, and has no runtime dependencies. Actual workerd execution
  remains required before completion.
- EventBridge, Azure Event Grid, and long-lived transports are outside this
  package.

Design:

- Add `@flue/stripe`, `examples/stripe-channel`, `flue add stripe`, a setup
  guide, and an API reference.
- Publish one fixed `POST /webhook` route.
- Accept the project-owned Stripe SDK `client` because the provider SDK owns
  exact-byte verification, timestamp tolerance, payload-mode validation, and
  native event types.
- Default to snapshot events for the ordinary
  `createStripeChannel({ client, webhookSecret, webhook })` experience.
- Support explicit `eventPayload: 'thin'` for API v2 event notifications.
  Both modes preserve the callback shape `webhook({ c, event })`; their option
  types discriminate `Stripe.Event` from
  `Stripe.V2.Core.EventNotification`.
- Use `constructEventAsync()` and `parseEventNotificationAsync()` so the same
  path executes under Node and Web Crypto runtimes.
- Expose optional signature tolerance and body-limit controls. Do not invent a
  general Stripe handler deadline because Stripe documents no universal
  numeric deadline.
- Preserve normal channel response behavior: no value becomes empty `200`,
  JSON-compatible values become JSON, and ordinary Hono or Fetch responses
  pass through.
- Do not add conversation-key helpers. Stripe has stable event and resource
  identifiers but no universal conversation identity; applications choose a
  customer, subscription, account, checkout session, or other resource key
  appropriate to their workflow.
- Do not add configured account/context restrictions. A destination may
  intentionally aggregate Connect accounts or organization contexts, and the
  signing secret already authenticates the configured destination. Application
  code owns narrower routing policy.

Dependencies and example:

- `@flue/stripe` depends directly on Hono and peers on both `stripe` and
  `@types/node`; Stripe's public declarations reference the latter even on its
  Worker entry. It does not depend on `@flue/runtime`.
- The implementation and example pin aged `stripe@22.2.0` for reproducible
  workspace installs. The newer v22.2.1 patch was less than 24 hours old during
  implementation and changed generated API resources rather than the webhook,
  event-notification, Fetch, Web Crypto, or Worker-export paths used here, so
  the repository's `minimumReleaseAge` policy was preserved.
- The editable example constructs and exports the official Stripe client with
  `Stripe.createFetchHttpClient()`, dispatches completed Checkout events, and
  defines a narrow tool bound to the already-selected customer.
- Workerd tests must execute snapshot and thin verification plus a real
  outbound SDK request against fake Fetch without `nodejs_compat`.

Non-goals:

- Event-destination registration, secret rotation, OAuth, API-key storage,
  deduplication, ordering, replay recovery, and broad outbound tools.
- A universal schema combining snapshot and thin payloads.
- A generic guarantee for synchronous event workflows such as real-time
  Issuing authorization. Applications may return provider responses through
  the normal handler API, but the package and example do not claim that
  specialized latency-sensitive workflow.

Foundation reflection to revisit after implementation:

- Whether accepting a provider SDK for verified ingress remains a clean
  exception to otherwise SDK-free channel packages.
- Whether snapshot and thin modes expose any weakness in the shared callback,
  response, package, example, or workerd conventions.

Implementation:

- Added `@flue/stripe` with one fixed `POST /webhook` route, default snapshot
  events, explicit thin event notifications, exact-byte official SDK
  verification, configurable signature tolerance and body limit, and the
  established Hono-compatible result contract.
- Added original Node and workerd protocol suites. They cover valid and
  tampered bytes, missing, malformed, rotated, and stale signatures, malformed
  JSON and event envelopes, payload-mode mismatches, media type, declared and
  streamed body limits, future snapshot event types, thin notifications with
  and without related objects, handler results, failures, constructor
  validation, and route publication.
- Added `examples/stripe-channel` with a project-owned official Fetch client,
  grouped Checkout completion cases, customer-scoped dispatch, a narrow
  customer-summary tool, trusted Connect or organization context binding,
  Node fake-Fetch coverage, and workerd fake-Fetch coverage.
- Added `flue add stripe`, the Stripe connector recipe, setup and API docs,
  navigation and channel overview entries, README, changelog, and publish
  wiring.

Validation:

- Package build, strict typecheck, 13 Node tests, and two workerd ingress tests
  pass. Workerd executes the official Stripe Worker export, Web Crypto snapshot
  and thin verification, context parsing, and SDK-provided fetch methods
  without `nodejs_compat`.
- Example strict typecheck, Node fake-client test, workerd fake-client test,
  Node build, and Cloudflare target build pass. The workerd test executes a
  real official SDK customer request against fake Fetch and confirms the Node
  HTTP client is unavailable in that runtime.
- A built Node application returned an empty `200` for an original locally
  signed event and `400` for the same exact payload with an invalid signature.
- The focused CLI suite passes, and the real built CLI returned the Stripe
  recipe through the locally built connector registry.
- Documentation typecheck and production build pass; the connector site build
  serves `/cli/connectors/stripe.md`.
- Publish preparation and package packing pass. The tarball contains only the
  intended distribution files, prepared docs, README, license, and manifest.
- A clean strict TypeScript consumer installed only the packed
  `@flue/stripe` package and `stripe`, compiled snapshot and thin handlers with
  a custom Hono environment, and imported the constructor at runtime.
- Credential-pattern and whitespace checks found no leaked provider secret or
  authentication logging. No verification contacted Stripe.

Corrections and deviations:

- Official Stripe declarations showed that valid thin notification families
  can omit `related_object`. The initial runtime guard rejected those
  deliveries, so it now accepts the absent field and coverage protects the
  provider-native behavior.
- The first packed-consumer check exposed that Stripe's Worker declarations
  still reference `@types/node` while Stripe declares that peer optional.
  `@flue/stripe` now declares it as a required peer, and the recipe explains
  the fallback for package managers that do not install peers automatically.
  Keeping it as a peer preserves one consumer-owned Stripe type graph and adds
  no Node runtime code to the Worker bundle.
- One early parallel command raced the example typecheck against a package
  build while `tsdown` replaced `dist`. Ordered package-then-example checks
  pass; this was verification ordering rather than an implementation defect.
- Workerd reports missing upstream Stripe source-map files, and Cloudflare
  builds repeat the existing example Durable Object migration warning. Both
  are non-failing upstream or repository-wide warnings, not Stripe channel
  runtime failures.

Foundation reflection:

- Accepting the provider SDK is a justified local exception: Stripe's official
  implementation owns signature compatibility, Web Crypto selection, native
  event construction, thin context parsing, and fetch helpers, and it executes
  in both required runtimes.
- Snapshot and thin payload modes fit the existing single-object callback,
  fixed-route discovery, and response contract without shared channel changes.
  Their differences remain explicit in one provider-specific discriminated
  constructor option.
- The only repeated machinery was ordinary body limiting and result
  serialization. No new failure scenario justifies extracting another shared
  channel runtime abstraction.
- No Stripe capability is deferred within ordinary stateless HTTPS event
  destinations. EventBridge, Azure Event Grid, registration, secret lifecycle,
  synchronous Issuing policy, deduplication, and outbound API breadth remain
  intentionally outside this channel.

Focused review:

- Independent review found the duplicate Stripe type graph caused by making
  `@types/node` a direct dependency. The final design uses a required
  compatible peer plus repository-only dev pins, and both the example and
  clean packed consumer now resolve one Stripe type instance.
- Review also confirmed that Stripe's generated snapshot and thin unions are
  closed even though the SDK forwards future verified event types. Widening
  the callback would destroy native known-event payload narrowing, so the API,
  guide, recipe, and README document the explicit `event.type as string`
  fallback until the project upgrades Stripe.
- Review found that Stripe rejects requests containing both `stripeAccount`
  and `stripeContext`. The example now prefers the richer verified context and
  falls back to the Connect account only when no context is present. Review
  also found that the initial `@types/node` peer range rejected newer
  compatible declarations; it now matches Stripe's `>=18` compatibility while
  retaining the repository's pinned development version.
- The built Node route has a valid and invalid signed smoke test. Workerd
  separately executes the same Hono ingress route and official verifier, and
  the complete example Worker artifact builds. A second provider assertion
  layer over generated Worker output would duplicate package protocol coverage
  without protecting a distinct contract.
- No unresolved correctness, security, packaging, Cloudflare, or developer
  experience findings remain.

## 6. Keep These As Separate Product Decisions

### Generic HTTP or webhook adapter

Flue already supports `flue add <provider-docs-url> --category channel` and a
custom-channel guide. A generic package cannot safely supply provider
verification, identity, retry, or response semantics.

Improve the custom-channel recipe, reusable test fixtures, and conformance
helpers before considering a generic runtime abstraction. Public demand:
<https://github.com/vercel/chat/issues/96>.

### Agent Client Protocol

ACP may be a direct agent transport rather than a provider webhook channel.
Evaluate its routing, session identity, streaming, and authentication against
Flue's existing agent HTTP and WebSocket surfaces before assigning ownership.
Public request: <https://github.com/vercel/chat/issues/552>.

## 7. Unsupported Transport Classes

Slack Socket Mode, Discord Gateway, Telegram polling, and similar persistent
connections are out of scope. They require lifecycle, reconnection, cursor,
heartbeat, and durable ownership semantics that the current HTTP channel model
does not provide.

Do not add a provider that requires one of these transports. Reconsider this
only through a separate product decision that intentionally introduces a
long-lived transport model; do not approximate it through channel route
declarations.

## Suggested Sequence

1. Release and deploy the completed ten-provider work.
2. Add the channel implementation and conformance agent skill.
3. Research Stripe, Notion, Resend, Shopify, Intercom, and Zendesk one at a
   time, shipping only after the HTTP and Cloudflare gates are proven.
4. Reassess existing HTTP provider expansions from user demand after the first
   channel release has real adoption data.

No additional channel was added during the final audit. Starting another
provider after the completed cross-provider review would require a fresh
research, implementation, testing, and audit cycle; the candidates above are
better handled as independent workstreams.
