# Flue

Flue is **The Agent Harness Framework.** If you know how to use Claude Code (or Codex, OpenCode, Pi, etc)... then you already know the basics of how to build agents with Flue.

Flue is a TypeScript framework for building the next generation of agents, designed around a built-in **agent harness**. It's like Claude Code, but 100% headless and programmable. There's no baked-in assumption like requiring a human operator to function. No TUI. No GUI. Just TypeScript.

But using Flue feels like using Claude Code. The agents you build act autonomously to solve problems and complete tasks. They require very little code to run — most of the "logic" lives in Markdown: skills, context, and `AGENTS.md`.

Flue isn't another AI SDK. It's a proper runtime-agnostic framework — think Astro or Next.js, but for agents. Write once, build, and deploy your agents anywhere (Node.js, Cloudflare, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, etc).

## Packages

| Package                       | Description                             |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| [`@flue/runtime`](packages/runtime) | Runtime: harness, sessions, tools, sandbox |
| [`@flue/cli`](packages/cli)   | CLI + build/dev tooling (`flue` binary)    |

## Examples

### Quickstart

The simplest agent — no container, no tools, just a prompt and a typed result.

Unless you opt-in to initializing a full container sandbox, Flue will default to a virtual sandbox for every agent, powered by [just-bash](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash). A virtual sandbox is going to be dramatically faster, cheaper, and more scalable than running a full container for every agent, which makes it perfect for building high-traffic/high-scale agents.

```ts
// .flue/actions/hello-world.ts
import type { FlueContext } from '@flue/runtime';
import * as v from 'valibot';

// Every agent needs a trigger. This agent is invoked as an API endpoint, via HTTP.
export const triggers = { webhook: true };

// The agent handler. Where the orchestration of the agent lives.
export default async function ({ init, payload }: FlueContext) {
  // `harness` -- Your initialized harness including sandbox, tools, skills, etc.
  const harness = await init({ model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6' });
  const session = await harness.session();

  // prompt() sends a message in the session, triggering action.
  const { data } = await session.prompt(`Translate this to ${payload.language}: "${payload.text}"`, {
    // Pass `result` to get typed, schema-validated data back from your agent.
    result: v.object({
      translation: v.string(),
      confidence: v.picklist(['low', 'medium', 'high']),
    }),
  });

  return data;
}
```

### Support Agent

A support agent can also run on Cloudflare without a container by using a cf-shell Workspace. The Workspace is a durable SQLite-indexed filesystem; R2 is an optional hydration source (and large-file spillover), not a live bucket mount. Copy the R2 objects you want into the Workspace before calling `init()`, then the agent operates on that structured filesystem through the `code` tool and `state.*` API.

Because this agent is deployed to Cloudflare, message history and session state are automatically persisted for you. So you (or your customer) can revisit this support session days, weeks, or years later and pick up exactly where you left off.

```ts
// .flue/actions/support.ts
import type { FlueContext } from '@flue/runtime';
import {
  getDefaultWorkspace,
  getShellSandbox,
  hydrateFromBucket,
} from '../connectors/cloudflare-shell';
import * as v from 'valibot';

export const triggers = { webhook: true };

export default async function ({ init, payload, env }: FlueContext) {
  const workspace = getDefaultWorkspace();

  // Hydrate once per agent instance. R2 is a source, not a live mount.
  if (!(await workspace.exists('/.hydrated'))) {
    await hydrateFromBucket(workspace, env.KNOWLEDGE_BASE);
    await workspace.writeFile('/.hydrated', new Date().toISOString());
  }

  const harness = await init({
    sandbox: getShellSandbox({ workspace, loader: env.LOADER }),
    model: 'openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.6',
  });
  const session = await harness.session();

  return await session.prompt(
    `You are a support agent. Use the code tool to search the hydrated
    workspace for articles relevant to this request, then write a helpful response.

    Customer: ${payload.message}`,
    {
      // Provide roles (aka subagents) to guide your agent. Defined in .flue/roles/
      role: 'triager',
    },
  );
}
```

This requires a `worker_loaders` binding (`{ "worker_loaders": [{ "binding": "LOADER" }] }`) in your `wrangler.jsonc`. If you need true bucket-keys-as-filesystem-paths semantics or Linux shell commands, use `@cloudflare/sandbox` Containers with `mountBucket` instead. See [Cloudflare Shell Sandbox](https://github.com/withastro/flue/blob/main/docs/cloudflare-shell.md) for the full migration and trade-offs.

### Issue Triage (CI)

A triage agent that runs in CI whenever an issue is opened on GitHub. The `local()` sandbox gives the agent direct access to the host filesystem and shell — perfect for CI runners, where `gh`, `git`, and `npm` are already on `$PATH` and the runner itself is your isolation boundary.

```ts
// .flue/actions/triage.ts
import { type FlueContext } from '@flue/runtime';
import { local } from '../connectors/local';
import * as v from 'valibot';

// Because we are running this in CI, we don't need to expose this as an HTTP endpoint.
// The CLI can run any agent from the command line, `flue run triage ...`
export const triggers = {};

export default async function ({ init, payload }: FlueContext) {
  // `local()` gives the agent direct access to the host filesystem and
  // shell. The agent's bash tool can run `gh`, `git`, `npm` directly.
  // Skills and AGENTS.md are discovered from process.cwd().
  //
  // Only a small allowlist of shell-essential env vars (PATH, HOME,
  // locale, etc.) is inherited from process.env by default. Pass
  // `env: { GH_TOKEN: process.env.GH_TOKEN }` to expose more.
  //
  // `model` sets the default model for every prompt/skill call in this
  // agent. Override per-call with `{ model: '...' }` on prompt()/skill().
  const harness = await init({
    sandbox: local({
      env: { GH_TOKEN: process.env.GH_TOKEN },
    }),
    model: 'anthropic/claude-opus-4-7',
  });
  const session = await harness.session();

  // Skills can be referenced either by their frontmatter `name:` (shown below)
  // or by a relative path under `.agents/skills/` — e.g.
  // `session.skill('triage/reproduce.md', ...)`. Path references are handy for
  // skill packs that group multiple stages under one directory.
  const { data } = await session.skill('triage', {
    // Pass arguments to any prompt or skill.
    args: { issueNumber: payload.issueNumber },
    // Result schemas are great for being able to act/orchestrate based on
    // the structured `data` returned from your prompt or skill call.
    result: v.object({
      severity: v.picklist(['low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical']),
      reproducible: v.boolean(),
      summary: v.string(),
      fix_applied: v.boolean(),
    }),
  });

  return data;
}
```

### Coding Agent (Remote Sandbox)

The examples above all run on a lightweight virtual sandbox — no container needed. But for a full coding agent, you want a real Linux environment with git, Node.js, a browser, and a cloned repo ready to go.

Daytona's declarative image builder lets you define the environment in code. The image is cached after the first build, so subsequent sessions start instantly.

Install the Daytona connector with `flue add daytona | <your-agent>` (e.g. `claude`, `opencode`, `codex`, `cursor-agent`). It writes a small `connectors/daytona.ts` adapter into your project that you import directly.

```ts
// .flue/actions/code.ts
import { Type, type FlueContext, type ToolDef } from '@flue/runtime';
import { Daytona } from '@daytona/sdk';
import { daytona } from '../connectors/daytona';

export const triggers = { webhook: true };

export default async function ({ init, payload, env }: FlueContext) {
  // Each agent gets a real container via Daytona. The container has
  // a full Linux environment with persistent filesystem and shell.
  //
  // For simplicity, we always create a new sandbox here. You could also
  // first check for an existing sandbox for the agent instance id, and reuse that
  // instead to best pick up where you last left off in the conversation.
  const client = new Daytona({ apiKey: env.DAYTONA_API_KEY });
  const sandbox = await client.create();
  const setupHarness = await init({
    sandbox: daytona(sandbox),
    model: 'openai/gpt-5.5',
  });
  const setup = await setupHarness.session();

  // For simplicity, we clone the target repo into the sandbox here.
  // You could also bake these into the container image snapshot for a
  // faster / near-instant startup.
  await setup.shell(`git clone ${payload.repo} /workspace/project`);
  await setup.shell('npm install', { cwd: '/workspace/project' });

  // Start a second harness in the cloned repo. It shares the same sandbox, but
  // discovers AGENTS.md and skills from /workspace/project.
  const projectHarness = await init({
    name: 'project',
    sandbox: daytona(sandbox),
    cwd: '/workspace/project',
    model: 'openai/gpt-5.5',
  });
  const session = await projectHarness.session();

  // Coding agents don't hide the agent DX from the user, so no need to
  // wrap the user's prompt in anything. Just send it to the agent directly
  // and then stream back the progress and final results.
  return await session.prompt(payload.prompt);
}
```

### Remote MCP Tools

MCP is available as a runtime tool adapter. Connect to a remote MCP server in trusted code, pass its tools to `init()`, and keep secrets in `env` instead of filesystem context or prompts.

```ts
// .flue/actions/assistant.ts
import { connectMcpServer, type FlueContext } from '@flue/runtime';

export const triggers = { webhook: true };

export default async function ({ init, payload, env }: FlueContext) {
  const github = await connectMcpServer('github', {
    url: 'https://mcp.github.com/mcp',
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${env.GITHUB_TOKEN}`,
    },
  });

  try {
    const harness = await init({
      model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6',
      tools: github.tools,
    });
    const session = await harness.session();
    return await session.prompt(payload.prompt);
  } finally {
    await github.close();
  }
}
```

`connectMcpServer()` defaults to modern streamable HTTP. For legacy SSE servers, pass `transport: 'sse'`. Flue does not auto-detect transports, spawn local stdio MCP servers, or handle OAuth callbacks in this first version.

## Agents, Harnesses, And Sessions

An action is the source file in `actions/<name>.ts`; it exposes an agent route when it declares a webhook trigger. For HTTP agents, the URL `<id>` segment identifies the agent instance: the durable runtime scope for one customer, repo, conversation space, or other caller-defined boundary.

```txt
POST /agents/<agent-name>/<id>
```

Inside a run, `init()` creates a harness: a configured handle for model defaults, tools, sandbox, filesystem, and sessions. The default harness is named `"default"`; pass `init({ name })` when one run needs multiple isolated harness scopes.

By default, `harness.session()` opens the default session inside the default harness for that agent instance. Reuse the same URL `<id>` to continue the same agent instance. Use a new URL `<id>` to start fresh.

```bash
# Start a conversation (port 3583 is `flue dev`'s default)
curl http://localhost:3583/agents/hello/session-abc \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Alice"}'

# Continue that conversation
curl http://localhost:3583/agents/hello/session-abc \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Alice"}'

# Start a separate conversation
curl http://localhost:3583/agents/hello/session-xyz \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Alice"}'
```

Agent instances own sandbox state such as files written during a run. Harnesses group related session state within an instance. Sessions persist message history and conversation metadata inside a harness. On Cloudflare, session data is backed by Durable Objects and survives across requests. On Node.js, sessions are stored in memory by default unless you provide a custom store.

In production, generate a stable URL `<id>` for the agent instance you want to preserve. Use `harness.session(threadName)` when you need multiple conversations inside the same harness.

### Tasks

Use `session.task()` to run a focused, one-shot child agent in a detached session. Tasks share the same sandbox/filesystem, but get their own message history and discover `AGENTS.md` plus `.agents/skills/` from their working directory. The same `task` tool is also available to the LLM during `prompt()` and `skill()` calls, so the agent can delegate parallel research or exploration work itself.

```ts
const session = await harness.session();

const research = await session.task('Research the auth flow and summarize the key files.', {
  cwd: '/workspace/project',
  role: 'researcher',
});

const answer = await session.prompt(
  `Use this research to draft the implementation plan:\n\n${research.text}`,
);
```

Roles can be set at the harness, session, or call level. Precedence is `call role > session role > harness role`. Role instructions are applied as call-scoped system prompt overlays, not injected into the persisted user message history.

```ts
const harness = await init({ model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6', role: 'coder' });
const session = await harness.session('review-thread', { role: 'reviewer' });

await session.prompt('Review the latest changes.'); // uses reviewer
await session.task('Research related issues.', { role: 'researcher' }); // uses researcher
```

### Provider Settings

Use `providers` when model traffic needs provider-specific runtime settings,
such as an enterprise API gateway, provider-compatible proxy, custom endpoint,
or gateway-specific credentials. This is common for managed credentials, audit
logging, traffic routing, or self-hosted OpenAI-compatible providers.

Configure these settings in `app.ts` instead of mutating global model state. They
apply to every harness and session that resolves models through that provider.

```ts
// .flue/app.ts
import { configureProvider, flue } from '@flue/runtime/app';

export default {
  fetch(req, env, ctx) {
    configureProvider('anthropic', {
      baseUrl: env.ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL,
      headers: { 'X-Custom-Auth': env.GATEWAY_KEY },
      // Use this when the proxy expects a synthetic or gateway-specific key.
      apiKey: 'dummy',
    });

    return flue().fetch(req, env, ctx);
  },
};
```

### Custom Virtual Sandboxes

For most agents, use the built-in virtual sandbox or `sandbox: local()` (Node target only). If you need to customize just-bash directly, pass a Bash factory. The factory must return a fresh Bash-like runtime each time; share the filesystem object in the closure to persist files across sessions and prompts.

```ts
import { Bash, InMemoryFs } from 'just-bash';

const fs = new InMemoryFs();

const harness = await init({
  sandbox: () => new Bash({ fs, cwd: '/workspace', python: true }),
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6',
});
const session = await harness.session();
```

## Connectors

Connectors adapt third-party services (sandbox providers, etc.) into Flue. They are not an npm package — they are markdown installation instructions hosted at `https://flueframework.com/cli/connectors/` and applied to your project by your AI coding agent.

```bash
flue add                                            # list available connectors
flue add daytona | claude                           # pipe to your coding agent (claude, opencode, codex, cursor-agent, ...)
flue add https://e2b.dev --category sandbox | claude   # build one from scratch — pass the provider's docs URL as the agent's starting point
```

The CLI fetches the markdown for the named connector and prints it to stdout when run by an agent (or with `--print`), or shows a short copyable `flue add ... | <agent>` recipe when run by a human in a terminal. Your agent reads the markdown and writes a small TypeScript adapter into `./.flue/connectors/<name>.ts` (or `./connectors/<name>.ts` for the root layout).

## Running Agents

### Local Development (`flue dev`)

Long-running watch-mode dev server. Rebuilds and reloads on file changes — edit an agent, re-run `curl`, see your change.

```bash
flue dev --target node          # Node.js dev server
flue dev --target cloudflare    # Cloudflare Workers (via wrangler) dev server
```

Defaults to port `3583` ("FLUE" on a phone keypad). Override with `--port`.

`flue dev --target cloudflare` requires `wrangler` as a peer dependency in your project (`npm install --save-dev wrangler`).

#### Loading environment variables

Pass `--env <path>` to load a `.env`-format file. Works for both targets:

```bash
flue dev --target node --env .env
flue dev --target cloudflare --env .env
```

Repeatable; later files override earlier ones on key collision. Shell-set env vars win over file values. Edits to the file trigger a reload. Same flag works for `flue run`.

### Trigger From the CLI (`flue run`)

Build and run any agent locally, perfect for running in CI or for one-shot scripted invocations. Production-shaped — builds the deployable artifact and starts it once.

```bash
flue run hello --target node --id test-1 \
  --payload '{"text": "Hello world", "language": "French"}'
```

### Trigger From HTTP Endpoint (`flue build`)

Build and deploy your agents as a web server, perfect for hosted agents.

`flue build` builds to a `./dist` directory, which you can then deploy. Cloudflare and any Node.js host are supported today, with more coming in the future.

```
flue build --target node          # Node.js server (single bundled .mjs)
flue build --target cloudflare    # Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects
```

For Cloudflare, `flue build` produces an unbundled TypeScript entry that `wrangler deploy` bundles itself — the same path `flue dev --target cloudflare` uses. Dev and deploy go through the same bundler, so what works in dev will work in production.
