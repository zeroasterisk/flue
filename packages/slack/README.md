# `@flue/slack`

Verified Slack Events API, interactivity, and slash-command ingress for Flue
applications.

```ts
import { createSlackChannel } from '@flue/slack';

export const channel = createSlackChannel({
  signingSecret: process.env.SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET!,

  // Path: /channels/slack/events
  async events({ c, payload }) {
    if (payload.type !== 'event_callback') return;

    switch (payload.event.type) {
      case 'app_mention':
        await handleMention(payload.event, payload.event_id);
        return;
      default:
        console.log(c.req.header('x-slack-retry-num'));
        return;
    }
  },

  // Omit this callback to omit the route.
  // Path: /channels/slack/interactions
  async interactions({ payload }) {
    await handleInteraction(payload);
  },

  // Omit this callback to omit the route.
  // Path: /channels/slack/commands
  async commands({ c, payload }) {
    return c.json({ response_type: 'ephemeral', text: `Received ${payload.command}` });
  },
});
```

Place the named `channel` export in `channels/slack.ts`. Flue serves configured
surfaces at:

- `POST /channels/slack/events`
- `POST /channels/slack/interactions`
- `POST /channels/slack/commands`

Paths are relative to the `flue()` mount. Omitting a callback omits its route;
at least one callback is required.

The package verifies Slack signatures over exact request bytes, enforces the
five-minute timestamp window, and handles URL verification internally.
Authenticated deliveries preserve Slack's field names, nesting, and
discriminants, including workspace and enterprise identity for application
authorization. Nested Events API events use the official `SlackEvent` type from
`@slack/types`, which this package re-exports.

Returning nothing produces an empty `200`. JSON-compatible values become JSON
responses, and ordinary Hono or Fetch `Response` values pass through. Callback
errors flow through normal Hono error handling.

This package does not include an outbound Slack client or model tools. Run
`flue add channel slack` for editable project code using the official
`@slack/web-api` client. Conversation keys are stable thread identifiers, not
authorization capabilities. The package is stateless and does not deduplicate
Events API retries.
