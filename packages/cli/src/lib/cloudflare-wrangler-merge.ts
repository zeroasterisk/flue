/**
 * Merge Flue's Cloudflare additions into the user's wrangler config.
 *
 * Philosophy: the user's wrangler config is the source of truth. Flue contributes
 * the pieces it owns (the Worker entrypoint, its per-agent Durable Object
 * bindings, the Sandbox DO, the migration tag) and leaves everything else
 * untouched. The merged result is written to `dist/wrangler.jsonc` so the
 * deployed Worker sees both.
 *
 * We delegate parsing and normalization to wrangler's own `unstable_readConfig`
 * (lazy-imported so Node-only Flue users don't pay for it). This gets us:
 *   - Both jsonc and TOML support for free.
 *   - Wrangler's own validation diagnostics (clearer errors than ours).
 *   - Path normalization: relative paths in fields like `containers[].image`
 *     are resolved to absolute paths against the user's config dir before
 *     we merge. This is critical because we write the merged config to
 *     `dist/wrangler.jsonc` — wrangler resolves relative paths against the
 *     config file's own directory, so without normalization a user's
 *     `containers[].image: "./Dockerfile"` would resolve to `dist/Dockerfile`
 *     after the move and fail to deploy.
 *
 * Flue still owns merge semantics (DO binding de-dup by `name`, migration
 * append-if-tag-absent) and Flue-specific validation (compat date floor,
 * required compat flags) — wrangler doesn't know about those.

// ─── Migration planning ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * Compute Flue's migration contributions for a build.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *
 * 1. Walk every existing migration entry in the user's config and union the
 *    SQLite-backed classes it declares — across `new_sqlite_classes` and
 *    the `to` side of `renamed_classes` / `transferred_classes`. The
 *    resulting set is "already-declared": every SQLite-backed class
 *    Cloudflare's runtime currently knows about for this Worker.
 *    `deleted_classes` and the `from` side of renames are subtracted, since
 *    they've been explicitly removed.
 *
 *    KV-backed classes (`new_classes`) are deliberately NOT added to the
 *    "declared" set. Flue agents always need a SQLite-backed class for
 *    session storage; if a user happens to have a KV-backed DO with the
 *    same name as a Flue agent, we still need to emit our SQLite migration.
 *    The deploy itself will then surface a clear "class already defined"
 *    error from Cloudflare rather than silently shipping a broken worker
 *    where the agent has no working session store.
 * 2. For each class in `currentClasses` that isn't already-declared, emit a
 *    deterministic per-class migration: one tag, one class. Per-class tags
 *    are essential because Cloudflare migration tags are immutable once
 *    deployed — packing all classes under a single shared tag (the original
 *    bug in issue #15) means new classes added on a redeploy are silently
 *    ignored. With per-class tags, every redeploy is a no-op except for
 *    the truly net-new classes.
 *
 * Renames and deletes are not auto-detected. If an agent file disappears,
 * Flue silently emits no migration for it — Cloudflare's runtime keeps the
 * orphaned class data alive but unbound, and the user can clean up (or
 * rename to recover) by adding a manual `renamed_classes` / `deleted_classes`
 * migration to their own wrangler.jsonc. Auto-emitting `deleted_classes`
 * would destroy stored DO data on every accidental file removal, which is
 * never the right default.
 *
 * Returned in alphabetical order so a regenerated `dist/wrangler.jsonc` is
 * byte-identical across machines and CI runs.
 *
 * Pure function: takes the current class list + the user's existing
 * migrations array (typically `userConfig.migrations` straight from
 * wrangler's reader) and returns the migrations to append. Doesn't read or
 * write any files.
