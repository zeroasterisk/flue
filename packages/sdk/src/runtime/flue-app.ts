/**
 * Public Hono sub-app exposing Flue's built-in agent route.
 *
 * Two consumers:
 *
 *   1. **User `app.ts` files.** Users mount this sub-app inside their own
 *      Hono app via `app.route('/', flue())`. The user owns the outer
 *      Hono and controls everything around Flue's routes (logging,
 *      auth, custom routes, framework-level error handlers).
 *
 *   2. **The default fallback when no `app.ts` exists.** {@link
 *      createDefaultFlueApp} wraps `flue()` in a thin outer Hono so the
 *      no-customization case ships the same routes as it always has.
 *
 * Only the agent route at `/agents/:name/:id` is exposed. `/health` and
 * `/agents` are NOT mounted — projects that want them add them in their
 * own `app.ts`. The magic surface stays minimal; users opt in to
 * whatever shape of liveness / introspection endpoint they actually
 * want.
 *
 * Targets diverge inside the agent route:
 *
 *   - **Node**: dispatches in-process via `handleAgentRequest` against
 *     the seeded handler map.
 *   - **Cloudflare**: forwards to `routeAgentRequest()` (provided by
 *     the seeded runtime), which reaches the per-agent Durable Object
 *     class. The DO's `onRequest` then calls `handleAgentRequest`
 *     itself with the CF-specific keepalive / fiber wrappers.
 *
 * The split is invisible to the user. They `import { flue } from
 * '@flue/sdk/app'` and mount it the same way regardless of target. See
 * {@link configureFlueRuntime} for the seeding contract that lets user
 * `app.ts` files call `flue()` at top level.
