# Deploy Agents on Cloudflare

Build and deploy Flue agents on Cloudflare Workers. This guide walks you through the different kinds of agents you can build — from simple prompt-and-response endpoints to full coding agents backed by persistent storage and remote sandboxes.

By the end, you will have a Flue agent running on Cloudflare Workers, and you will know how to add roles, R2-backed context, Cloudflare sandboxes, and Durable Object-backed sessions.

## Project layout

The project root is your project directory. Flue scans action handlers from one of two places, analogous to Next.js's `src/` folder:

- `./actions/` — bare layout, source at the project root.
- `./.flue/actions/` — `.flue/` source layout. When you opt into this, treat `.flue/` as the home for everything action-related (connectors, session stores, helpers, …).

Only `actions/` is structural. Agent definitions, skills, tools, and any other TypeScript your actions import can live wherever you prefer.

If `./.flue/` exists, Flue reads sources from there; otherwise it reads from the project root. The two layouts never mix. By default `flue build` writes to `./dist/` at the project root; pass `--output <path>` to redirect the build elsewhere. `wrangler.jsonc` and any `Dockerfile` you ship live at the project root, regardless of where the build lands. Examples in this guide use the `./.flue/` layout — drop the prefix if you prefer the bare layout.

## Hello World

The simplest agent — no container, no storage, just a prompt and a typed result.

### 1. Set up your project

```bash
mkdir my-flue-worker && cd my-flue-worker
npm init -y
npm install @flue/runtime valibot agents
npm install -D @flue/cli wrangler
```

`agents` is Cloudflare's Agents SDK — Flue uses it to route HTTP requests to a per-agent Durable Object. If you also need a remote sandbox, additionally install `@cloudflare/sandbox` (see [Connecting a remote sandbox](#connecting-a-remote-sandbox) below).

### 2. Create your first agent

`.flue/actions/translate.ts`:

```typescript
import type { FlueContext } from '@flue/runtime';
import * as v from 'valibot';

export const triggers = { webhook: true };

export default async function ({ init, payload }: FlueContext) {
  const harness = await init({ model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6' });
  const session = await harness.session();

  const { data } = await session.prompt(`Translate this to ${payload.language}: "${payload.text}"`, {
    result: v.object({
      translation: v.string(),
      confidence: v.picklist(['low', 'medium', 'high']),
    }),
  });

  return data;
}
```

A few things to note:

- **`triggers = { webhook: true }`** — This agent is invoked via HTTP. Flue creates a route for it automatically.
- **`init({ model })`** — Every session needs a model. If you do not pass one, no model is chosen and `prompt()` / `skill()` calls will fail. By default, Flue gives every agent a virtual sandbox powered by [just-bash](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash). No container needed.
- **Schemas** — The [Valibot](https://valibot.dev) schema defines the expected output shape. Flue parses the agent's response and returns it on `response.data`, fully typed.

### 3. Build and deploy

```bash
npx flue build --target cloudflare
npx wrangler deploy
```

`flue build --target cloudflare` compiles your project into a `./dist` directory containing a Cloudflare Workers-compatible artifact. `wrangler deploy` pushes it live.

### 4. Add your API key

Put provider API keys in a `.env` file at the project root:

```bash
cat > .env <<'EOF'
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
EOF

printf '\n.env\n' >> .gitignore
```

Use the env var name your provider expects — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Anthropic, `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI, and so on. Do not commit `.env`.

Pass the file explicitly with `--env <path>`. Flue loads it for both `flue dev` and `flue run` (the same flag works for Node and Cloudflare targets):

```bash
npx flue dev --target cloudflare --env .env
```

For deploying, Wrangler reads the same file:

```bash
npx flue build --target cloudflare
npx wrangler deploy --secrets-file .env
```

> **Note on `.dev.vars`.** Wrangler's docs use `.dev.vars` as the convention for local secrets. The format is identical to `.env`, and you can call your file whatever you like — Flue just needs a path. We use `.env` in these examples because it's the broader Node/Web convention and works the same way regardless of which target you're using.

### 5. Try it locally

For local development, use `flue dev --target cloudflare`. It builds your project root, then starts a Cloudflare Workers dev server (via wrangler) on port 3583 and watches for changes:

```bash
npx flue dev --target cloudflare --env .env
```

Then test it:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3583/agents/translate/test-1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello world", "language": "French"}'
```

`flue run` starts the generated server in Node.js, so it only supports `--target node`. Cloudflare builds use Worker-only runtime modules — `flue dev --target cloudflare` is the equivalent for testing them locally.

## Roles

Roles shape agent behavior across prompts. They live alongside your agents — under `./roles/` (or `./.flue/roles/` if you use the `.flue/` layout) — and ship with your deployed worker:

`.flue/roles/triager.md`:

```markdown
---
description: A support agent that triages customer requests
---

You are a support triager. Search the knowledge base thoroughly before
responding. Always cite the specific articles you referenced. Be empathetic
but concise.
```

Use a role by passing its name to `prompt()`:

```typescript
await session.prompt('Help me reset my password', {
  role: 'triager',
});
```

## Using the sandbox

By default, the virtual sandbox starts empty — no files, no skills, no context. This is fine for stateless prompt-and-response agents like the translator above. But many agents need files to work with.

Because the agent has shell access, it can set up its own workspace on the fly:

```typescript
import type { FlueContext } from '@flue/runtime';

export const triggers = { webhook: true };

export default async function ({ init, payload }: FlueContext) {
  const harness = await init({ model: 'openai/gpt-5.5' });
  const session = await harness.session();

  // The agent has a full virtual filesystem and shell.
  // Set up context files before prompting.
  await session.shell(`mkdir -p /workspace/data`);
  await session.shell(`cat > /workspace/data/config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "rules": ["Be concise", "Use bullet points", "Cite sources"],
  "tone": "professional"
}
EOF`);

  return await session.prompt(
    `Read the config in /workspace/data/config.json.
     Generate a report about: ${payload.topic}`,
  );
}
```

The agent can use its built-in tools — grep, glob, read — to search and read these files. This is still running on a virtual sandbox (no container), so it's fast and cheap.

## Workspace-backed agents

Inline files work for small, static content. But for larger datasets — a knowledge base, documentation corpus, product catalog — you want persistent storage. On Cloudflare, the lightweight non-container path is [`@cloudflare/shell`](./cloudflare-shell.md): a durable SQLite-indexed `Workspace` plus a `code` tool that runs JavaScript against `state.*` in an isolated Worker.

R2 is a good source for that workspace, but it is not a live filesystem mount. Hydrate the R2 objects you want into the Workspace before `init()`, then the agent operates on the Workspace. Install the workspace sandbox with `flue add cloudflare-shell`; the connector file includes the `hydrateFromBucket()` helper used below. Install `@cloudflare/shell` directly if you want to construct custom Workspaces or hydrate from git.

### The support agent pattern

This is one of the most powerful patterns on Cloudflare: a support agent that searches a knowledge base to answer customer questions. The knowledge base can be stored in R2, hydrated once into the Workspace, and then searched through the `code` tool with `state.searchFiles`, `state.glob`, `state.readFile`, and related APIs.

`.flue/actions/support.ts`:

```typescript
import type { FlueContext } from '@flue/runtime';
import {
  getDefaultWorkspace,
  getShellSandbox,
  hydrateFromBucket,
} from '../connectors/cloudflare-shell';

export const triggers = { webhook: true };

export default async function ({ init, payload, env }: FlueContext) {
  const workspace = getDefaultWorkspace();

  if (!(await workspace.exists('/.hydrated'))) {
    await hydrateFromBucket(workspace, env.KNOWLEDGE_BASE);
    await workspace.writeFile('/.hydrated', new Date().toISOString());
  }

  const harness = await init({
    sandbox: getShellSandbox({ workspace, loader: env.LOADER }),
    model: 'openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.6',
  });
  const session = await harness.session();

  return await session.prompt(
    `You are a support agent. Use the code tool to search the hydrated
    workspace for articles relevant to this request, then write a helpful response.

    Customer: ${payload.message}`,
    {
      role: 'triager',
    },
  );
}
```

### Adding the bindings

Add a Worker Loader binding and the R2 bucket to your project's `wrangler.jsonc` (at the root of your project, alongside `package.json`):

```jsonc
{
  "name": "my-support-agent",
  "compatibility_date": "2026-04-01",
  "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],
  "worker_loaders": [{ "binding": "LOADER" }],
  "r2_buckets": [
    {
      "binding": "KNOWLEDGE_BASE",
      "bucket_name": "my-knowledge-base",
    },
  ],
}
```

Worker Loader is currently in beta. If `wrangler dev` local mode does not simulate `worker_loaders`, use `wrangler dev --remote` or deploy to a preview environment.

When you run `flue build --target cloudflare`, Flue merges its own Durable Object bindings into this file and writes the composed config to `dist/wrangler.jsonc`. `wrangler deploy` picks that up automatically via a redirect at `.wrangler/deploy/config.json` — so you can keep editing only your root `wrangler.jsonc` and bindings like this R2 binding will flow through to deploy. You don't need to set `main` yourself; Flue owns the bundle entrypoint.

Upload your knowledge base to R2 using Wrangler:

```bash
# Upload individual files
wrangler r2 object put my-knowledge-base/articles/getting-started.md --file ./docs/getting-started.md

# Or upload a directory
for f in ./docs/**/*.md; do
  key="articles/${f#./docs/}"
  wrangler r2 object put "my-knowledge-base/$key" --file "$f"
done
```

### Why this works well

- **No container** — Still running on a virtual sandbox. Fast startup, low cost.
- **Persistent data** — The workspace lives in Durable Object SQLite, with optional R2 spillover for large files.
- **Explicit sources** — R2, git, or any other source can hydrate the workspace before the agent runs.
- **Agent-native search** — The agent uses the `code` tool and `state.*` APIs to list, read, search, and edit files.
- **Session persistence** — Because this deploys to Cloudflare Workers with Durable Objects, message history and session state are automatically persisted. A customer can revisit a support session days later and pick up where they left off.

If you specifically need bucket keys to appear as filesystem paths, use `@cloudflare/sandbox` Containers with [`mountBucket`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/guides/mount-buckets/) instead. That is the right tool for Linux shell commands and live bucket-mount semantics.

## Connecting a remote sandbox

The examples above all run on virtual sandboxes — no container needed. But for agents that need a full Linux environment — git, Node.js, a browser, system packages — you want a remote sandbox.

Cloudflare has native container support via [`@cloudflare/sandbox`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/). Each session gets its own isolated container with a persistent filesystem, shell, and full Linux userspace.

If you'd rather connect to an external provider — e.g. Daytona — instead of running the sandbox on Cloudflare, see [Connect a Daytona Sandbox](./connect-daytona.md).

### Setup

You own the container config. That means three things:

1. Install `@cloudflare/sandbox`: `npm install @cloudflare/sandbox`.
2. Declare the Durable Object binding, migration, and container image in your `wrangler.jsonc` at the project root.
3. Commit a `Dockerfile` at the path your `containers[].image` points to.

Flue automates one piece: **any DO binding whose `class_name` ends with `Sandbox` is automatically wired up as `@cloudflare/sandbox`'s `Sandbox` class in the generated Worker bundle.** Pick any name you want (`Sandbox`, `PyBoxSandbox`, `SupportSandbox`, …) and Flue handles the re-export.

### Example

`wrangler.jsonc` (at the project root, alongside `package.json`):

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://workers.cloudflare.com/schema/wrangler.json",
  "name": "my-agent",
  "compatibility_date": "2026-04-01",
  "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],
  "durable_objects": {
    "bindings": [{ "class_name": "Sandbox", "name": "Sandbox" }]
  },
  "migrations": [{ "tag": "v1", "new_sqlite_classes": ["Sandbox"] }],
  "containers": [{ "class_name": "Sandbox", "image": "./Dockerfile" }]
}
```

`Dockerfile` (at the project root):

```dockerfile
FROM docker.io/cloudflare/sandbox:0.9.2
```

The base image is published by Cloudflare and bundles the control-plane HTTP server that `@cloudflare/sandbox` needs to communicate with the container, along with `node`, `git`, `curl`, and a working directory at `/workspace`. Pin the tag to match the `@cloudflare/sandbox` version in your `package.json` — they're versioned together. Add your own `RUN` lines to install extra tools as needed.

`.flue/actions/assistant.ts`:

```typescript
import type { FlueContext } from '@flue/runtime';
import { getSandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

export const triggers = { webhook: true };

export default async function ({ init, id, env, payload }: FlueContext) {
  // The binding name you chose in wrangler.jsonc is the key on `env`.
  const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, id);
  const harness = await init({ sandbox, model: 'anthropic/claude-opus-4-7' });
  const session = await harness.session();

  return await session.prompt(payload.message);
}
```

### Multiple sandboxes

Different agents can use different container images. Declare a separate binding for each (each `class_name` must contain `Sandbox`), and give each its own container entry:

```jsonc
{
  "durable_objects": {
    "bindings": [
      { "class_name": "PyBoxSandbox", "name": "PyBox" },
      { "class_name": "NodeSandbox", "name": "NodeBox" }
    ]
  },
  "migrations": [
    { "tag": "v1", "new_sqlite_classes": ["PyBoxSandbox", "NodeSandbox"] }
  ],
  "containers": [
    { "class_name": "PyBoxSandbox", "image": "./docker/python.Dockerfile" },
    { "class_name": "NodeSandbox", "image": "./docker/node.Dockerfile" }
  ]
}
```

Each agent grabs the sandbox it needs: `getSandbox(env.PyBox, id)` or `getSandbox(env.NodeBox, id)`.

### Secure egress with outbound Workers

When your agent runs in a container, it may need to call external APIs — GitHub, npm registries, internal services. The traditional approach is to inject API tokens as environment variables, but that means the agent (and the LLM) has direct access to those secrets.

Cloudflare Sandboxes solve this with [outbound Workers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/sandbox-auth/) — a programmable egress proxy that intercepts outgoing HTTP/HTTPS requests from the container. Secrets are injected at the proxy layer, so the container never sees them. This is configured on the Cloudflare Sandbox class, outside of your Flue agent code:

```typescript
class MySandbox extends Sandbox {
  static outboundByHost = {
    'api.github.com': (request, env, ctx) => {
      const headers = new Headers(request.headers);
      headers.set('Authorization', `Bearer ${env.GITHUB_TOKEN}`);
      return fetch(request, { headers });
    },
  };
}
```

This is a zero-trust model — no token is ever granted to the untrusted sandbox. The proxy runs on the same machine as the container, so latency is minimal. You can also use outbound Workers to log requests, block specific domains, or enforce dynamic policies that change over the lifetime of a session.

For full details, see the [outbound Workers documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/platform-details/outbound-traffic/).

### When to use a remote sandbox

| Virtual sandbox                  | Remote sandbox                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Millisecond startup              | Seconds to start (cached images are faster) |
| Grep, glob, read, basic shell    | Full Linux: git, Node.js, Python, browsers  |
| R2 or inline files               | Real persistent filesystem                  |
| High-traffic / high-scale agents | Coding agents, complex dev environments     |

Most agents don't need a remote sandbox. Start with a virtual sandbox and only move to a remote sandbox when you need the full environment.

## Session persistence

When deploying to Cloudflare, Flue uses Durable Objects to automatically persist session state — message history, context, and sandbox state all survive across requests. This means you can build conversational agents where users pick up exactly where they left off.

This is built in when you deploy with `--target cloudflare`. No extra configuration needed.

## Sandbox context

`AGENTS.md` and skills are optional workspace-context files that the agent reads from its sandbox at `init()` time. They live at conventional paths inside whatever sandbox the agent is using — Flue looks for `<cwd>/AGENTS.md` and `<cwd>/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Whatever's there gets loaded; whatever isn't, doesn't. Most agents don't need either to do useful work.

If you want to use them, put them in your sandbox. How you do that depends on which sandbox you're using: hydrate them into a cf-shell Workspace from R2 or git before `init()`, `COPY` them in for a container, or write them in via `session.shell()` on a sandbox that supports shell execution.

**Skills** are reusable agent tasks defined as markdown files in `.agents/skills/`. They give the agent a focused instruction set for a specific job:

`.agents/skills/greet/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: greet
description: Generate a personalized greeting for a given name.
---

Given the name provided in the arguments, generate a warm, personalized
greeting. Keep it to one or two sentences.
```

**`AGENTS.md`** at the root of the sandbox is the agent's system prompt — it provides global context about the project.

```markdown
You are a helpful assistant working on the my-project codebase.
Use the project's existing patterns and conventions.
```

Call a skill from your agent:

```typescript
const { data } = await session.skill('greet', {
  args: { name: 'World' },
  result: v.object({ greeting: v.string() }),
});
```

## Building and deploying

Flue compiles your project into a deployable artifact. For Cloudflare, this means a Workers-compatible bundle:

```bash
# Local development (build + watch + dev server on port 3583)
npx flue dev --target cloudflare --env .env

# One-off build for Cloudflare
npx flue build --target cloudflare

# Deploy to production (Wrangler reads the same .env as a secrets bundle)
npx wrangler deploy --secrets-file .env
```

Every agent with `triggers = { webhook: true }` gets an HTTP endpoint automatically. The route follows the pattern `/agents/<name>/<id>` — for example, `.flue/actions/translate.ts` becomes `/agents/translate/:id`.

```bash
# Hit your deployed agent
curl https://my-support-agent.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/agents/support/session-123 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "How do I reset my password?"}'
```

### Choosing a sandbox strategy

Here's the progression of sandbox types available on Cloudflare, from simplest to most powerful:

1. **Empty virtual sandbox** — `init({ model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6' })`. Fast, cheap, stateless. Good for prompt-and-response agents.
2. **Virtual sandbox with shell setup** — Use `session.shell()` to write files and configure the workspace. Still fast and cheap, good for agents that need small amounts of static context.
3. **cf-shell Workspace sandbox** — `getShellSandbox({ workspace, loader })`. Durable SQLite-indexed Workspace, hydrated from R2/git/etc., searched and edited through the `code` tool and `state.*`. Ideal for Cloudflare-native knowledge bases and support agents without Linux dependencies.
4. **Container sandbox** — Full Linux environment via `@cloudflare/sandbox`. For coding agents, complex dev environments, and anything that needs real system tools.

Start simple. Move up when you need to.
