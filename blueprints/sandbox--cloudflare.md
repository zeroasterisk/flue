# Add a Flue Blueprint: Cloudflare Sandbox

You are an AI coding agent helping a user wire up Cloudflare Sandbox in
their Flue project. **This is not a normal adapter.** Read this whole
file before you write or install anything — the right action is very
different depending on what target the project is already on.

## The single most important thing to tell the user

`@cloudflare/sandbox` is a Durable Object that runs Cloudflare's container
platform. **It only works inside a Worker** — it cannot be invoked from a
Node.js process. Because of that, Flue treats Cloudflare Sandbox as a
first-class **build target**, not a drop-in adapter file.

If the user is already on `--target cloudflare`: there is no project-owned
adapter file to install. Export the Sandbox class from the selected Flue source
root's `cloudflare.ts`, declare the binding in `wrangler.jsonc`, and wrap
`getSandbox(env.Sandbox, id)` with `cloudflareSandbox(...)` in the agent. Skip to
["Path A"](#path-a-already-on---target-cloudflare) below.

If the user is on `--target node` (or hasn't picked yet): adding Cloudflare
Sandbox means **migrating the entire project to deploy on Cloudflare
Workers**. This is a real, multi-step change — Workers, Durable Objects,
`wrangler`, container builds, the lot. Don't pretend it's a single-file
add. Skip to ["Path B"](#path-b-currently-on---target-node) and
**confirm with the user before proceeding**.

For other sandbox providers that are reachable from a Node-target Flue
project (Daytona, E2B, Modal, Vercel, etc.), see `flue add` for those
adapters instead. They install in one file and don't require a deploy
target change.

## Figure out which path you're on

Before writing anything, look at the user's project to determine the
current target:

1. Check `package.json` and any nearby scripts for `flue dev` /
   `flue build` invocations. The presence of `--target cloudflare`
   anywhere is a strong signal they're on Cloudflare already.
2. Check for `wrangler.jsonc` / `wrangler.toml` / `wrangler.json` at the
   project root. Cloudflare-targeted Flue projects always have one.
3. Check `package.json` `dependencies` for `wrangler` and `agents`.

If you find clear evidence of `--target cloudflare`: **Path A**.

If you find no Cloudflare wiring (no `wrangler.jsonc`, no `wrangler` dep,
all scripts use `--target node` or no target flag): **Path B** — and
**confirm with the user that they want to migrate** before doing anything.

If you can't tell or it's ambiguous: ask the user directly. Don't guess.

---

## Path A: Already on `--target cloudflare`

You don't need an adapter file. Flue's runtime package already exports the wiring,
and the deploy guide's "Connecting a remote sandbox" section is the
canonical blueprint. Steer the user there:

> https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/deploy/cloudflare/#connecting-a-remote-sandbox

The short version, for your reference:

1. Install `@cloudflare/sandbox` in the user's project:

   ```bash
   npm install @cloudflare/sandbox@^0.11.0
   ```

   (Use the user's package manager — `pnpm add`, `yarn add`, etc.)

2. Export the Sandbox class from the user's Cloudflare deployment module.
   Put `cloudflare.ts` in the selected Flue source root: `.flue/cloudflare.ts`
   when `.flue/` exists, otherwise `src/cloudflare.ts` when `src/` exists,
   otherwise `<root>/cloudflare.ts`:

   ```ts
   export { Sandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';
   ```

3. Add a Durable Object binding for the sandbox to the user's
   `wrangler.jsonc` at the project root:

   ```jsonc
   {
     "durable_objects": {
       "bindings": [{ "class_name": "Sandbox", "name": "Sandbox" }]
     },
     "migrations": [{ "tag": "v2", "new_sqlite_classes": ["Sandbox"] }],
     "containers": [{ "class_name": "Sandbox", "image": "./Dockerfile" }]
   }
   ```

   Preserve the user's existing top-level migration history and append a new
   uniquely tagged entry. Do not replace deployed agent, workflow, or
   `FlueRegistry` migrations.

4. Add a `Dockerfile` at the project root pinned to the matching
   `@cloudflare/sandbox` version:

   ```dockerfile
   FROM docker.io/cloudflare/sandbox:0.9.2
   ```

   (Replace `0.9.2` with whatever version was actually installed in step
   1 — Cloudflare publishes the base image with the same version tag as
   the npm package.)

5. Use it in an agent. The binding name from `wrangler.jsonc` (`Sandbox`
   above) is the key on `env`:

   ```ts
   import type { FlueContext, WorkflowRouteHandler } from '@flue/runtime';
   import { cloudflareSandbox } from '@flue/runtime/cloudflare';
   import { getSandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

   export const route: WorkflowRouteHandler = async (_c, next) => next();

   export async function run ({ init, id, env, payload }: FlueContext<{ message: string }>) {
     const sandbox = cloudflareSandbox(getSandbox(env.Sandbox, id));
     const harness = await init({ sandbox, model: 'anthropic/claude-opus-4-7' });
     const session = await harness.session();

     return await session.prompt(payload.message);
   }
   ```

   Pass the result of `getSandbox()` through `cloudflareSandbox(...)` before
   supplying it to `ctx.init(...)`. The wrapper is provided by
   `@flue/runtime/cloudflare`, so no project-owned adapter file is needed.

6. Tell the user to put local variables in `.dev.vars` or `.env` and run
   `flue dev --target cloudflare`, then `flue build --target cloudflare &&
   wrangler deploy --secrets-file .env` to deploy. No new env vars are required just for
   the sandbox itself; auth is the user's normal Cloudflare account auth
   via `wrangler login`.

If the user wants multiple sandbox images (e.g. one for Python, one for
Node), they can declare multiple bindings — see the "Multiple sandboxes"
section of the deploy guide.

## Path B: Currently on `--target node`

**Stop. Confirm with the user first.**

Adding Cloudflare Sandbox to a project that currently runs on Node is
**not** a one-file change. The sandbox itself is a Cloudflare Containers
Durable Object, which only exists inside a Cloudflare Worker. To use it,
the entire Flue project has to change its deploy target from Node to
Cloudflare Workers, which is a substantial migration that includes:

- Switching `flue dev` / `flue build` invocations to `--target cloudflare`.
- Adding `wrangler` and `agents` (Cloudflare's Agents SDK) as dependencies.
- Adding a `wrangler.jsonc` with Durable Object bindings, container
  bindings, and an R2 binding if they want persistent file storage.
- Adding a `Dockerfile` for the container image.
- Setting up Wrangler authentication (`wrangler login`) and a Cloudflare
  account that has Containers enabled (currently a Workers Paid feature).
- Reviewing any Node-only code in the user's existing agents and
  adapters. Anything that imports from `node:fs`, opens TCP sockets via
  `net`, uses `child_process`, or depends on long-lived background work
  needs rethinking on the Workers runtime.

Before doing any of this, **ask the user**:

1. Are you OK migrating this whole project to deploy on Cloudflare
   Workers? (yes/no)
2. Do you have a Cloudflare account with Containers access? (Containers
   is currently a Workers Paid feature.)

If they say no to either, **stop and recommend an alternative**. Other
sandbox adapters that work from a Node-target Flue project include:

- **Daytona** (`flue add sandbox daytona`) — provider-managed sandboxes via
  `@daytona/sdk`.
- **E2B** (`flue add sandbox e2b`) — Firecracker microVMs via the `e2b` package.
- **Modal** (`flue add sandbox modal`) — sandboxes on Modal's serverless platform.
- **Vercel Sandbox** (`flue add sandbox vercel`) — `@vercel/sandbox`.
- **boxd** (`flue add sandbox boxd`) — microVMs via `@boxd-sh/sdk`.
- **exe.dev** (`flue add sandbox exedev`) — SSH-accessed VMs.

These all keep the project on `--target node` and don't require a
platform migration.

If the user does say yes to migrating, **do not try to do the whole
migration in one shot**. Direct them at the canonical guide instead:

> https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/deploy/cloudflare/

That document walks through the migration end-to-end:

- Hello-world agent on Cloudflare (`flue dev --target cloudflare`).
- Adding `wrangler.jsonc`, `.env`, and `--target cloudflare` to scripts.
- Using Flue's default virtual sandbox if the user only needs an in-memory filesystem with built-in shell and file-search tools.
- Adding the Cloudflare Sandbox container at the end (which is the same
  blueprint as Path A above).

Read the guide, then walk the user through it section by section. Don't
short-circuit straight to writing a `wrangler.jsonc` and `Dockerfile`
without first confirming the basics work on `--target cloudflare`.

---

## Hard rules

- **Do not** create a `sandboxes/cloudflare.ts` file under any source
  directory. Import `cloudflareSandbox` from `@flue/runtime/cloudflare`; no
  project-owned adapter file is needed.
- **Do not** silently migrate a Node-target project to Cloudflare. Always
  confirm first.
- **Do not** invent a Cloudflare account, API token, or `account_id`. The
  user authenticates with `wrangler login` (or `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` in
  CI); never guess values.
- **Do not** pin the `cloudflare/sandbox:<version>` Docker tag to a
  version different from the `@cloudflare/sandbox` npm package version
  the user actually installed. They have to match.
- The `@cloudflare/sandbox` package is a separate Cloudflare-published dependency the user installs themselves. Don't import from `@flue/runtime/internal`.

When updating an existing integration, inspect and compare it against this complete current blueprint, apply every relevant change, and preserve customizations. This blueprint has no primary marked file, so comparison is the durable update path; do not add a marker to an auxiliary or deployment file.
